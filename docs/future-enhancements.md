# Future Enhancements & Next Steps

## 1. Context Enrichment - DEFERRED
### Value Type Integration
- Pass value types/labels into agent context alongside variables
- Would improve confidence scoring for conceptual matches (e.g., SEGMENT variables)
- Could flag variables missing value types during data map processing as warnings

## 2. Tracing Optimization - COMPLETED âœ…
### Solution Implemented
- Used `withTrace()` wrapper to create single unified trace for all group processing
- All group processing now appears under one trace instead of separate traces
- Each group's agent run becomes a span within the main trace
- Implemented `getGlobalTraceProvider().forceFlush()` for immediate trace export
- Trace ID capture and inclusion in API responses for debugging reference
- ESLint configuration updated to properly handle underscore-prefixed unused variables

## 2A. Banner Processing Agent Optimization - PLANNED
### Problem Identified
- Current BannerProcessor combines all columns into single mega-group instead of logical groups
- Missing group-by-group separation (e.g., Specialty, Role, Volume, Tiers should be separate groups)
- Limited visibility into banner extraction reasoning and decision-making process

### Solution Approach
- **Convert to Agent-Based Processing**: Replace traditional BannerProcessor with OpenAI Agents SDK
- **Add Scratchpad Tool**: Enable reasoning transparency ("I see visual separators... Cards/PCPs/Nephs are related...")
- **Enhanced Grouping Prompts**: Explicit instructions for identifying visual separators, headers, and logical groupings
- **Unified Tracing**: Apply same tracing patterns as CrossTab Agent for debugging group decisions
- **Reasoning Model Integration**: Leverage o1-preview for better logical grouping decisions
- **Schema-Driven Validation**: Ensure proper group structure with 2-8 columns per logical group

### Expected Benefits
- **Proper Group Separation**: Each logical category gets its own group for focused processing
- **Debugging Visibility**: Trace and scratchpad show exactly how grouping decisions are made
- **Architecture Consistency**: All major processing uses standardized Agents SDK patterns
- **Scalability**: Better handling of complex banner plans with many logical sections

## 3. Validation & Grading System
### Agent Performance Metrics
- Develop automated grading for agent outputs
- Compare against known-good mappings
- Track accuracy metrics across different types of expressions

### UI Enhancements
- Display agent decisions visually
- Show confidence scores with color coding
- Highlight variables selected and reasoning
- Enable manual override/correction interface

## 4. Output Processing Pipeline
### Banner Plan Merging
- Take CrossTab agent output
- Merge with original banner plan
- Override fields: adjusted, confidence, reason
- Create new enhanced banner plan with validation results
- Save merged output for downstream processing

### Total Column Addition
- Add "Total" column to banner plan post-CrossTab validation
- Enables significance testing between total and subgroups
- Could be deterministic logic or lightweight LLM call
- Assign appropriate statistical letter (typically 'T')
- Include universe/base definition for total

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow
- Trigger manual review when confidence < threshold (e.g., 0.70)
- Queue low-confidence mappings for human validation
- Track corrections for future training/prompt improvement
- Build feedback loop for continuous improvement

## 5. Testing Infrastructure
### Batch Processing System
- Process multiple banner plans/data maps in batch
- Collect performance metrics across diverse inputs
- A/B test different prompt versions systematically
- Generate accuracy reports and identify failure patterns

### Test Suite Development
- Curated set of banner plans with known-correct mappings
- Edge cases and complex expressions
- Performance benchmarks for processing speed
- Regression testing for prompt changes

### QA System
- **QA Agent/Module**: Automated quality assurance for outputs
- Validate R syntax correctness
- Check variable references exist in data
- Verify statistical logic consistency
- Flag potential issues before execution
- Could be agent-based or deterministic validation

## 6. R Script Generation
### Next Major Phase (Agent-Based)
- **R Script Generation Agent**: Convert validated mappings to executable R syntax
- Generate complete crosstab scripts with proper syntax
- Handle data transformations and aggregations
- Include significance testing logic
- Integration with R execution environment
- Agent will understand R best practices and optimization

## 7. Advanced Agent Capabilities
### Multi-Variable Logic
- Better handling of complex AND/OR combinations
- Nested conditional expressions
- Variable interaction patterns

### Learning from Corrections
- Store human corrections as training examples
- Refine prompts based on common errors
- Build domain-specific knowledge base

## 8. System Optimization
### Performance Improvements
- Parallel processing optimization
- Caching for repeated validations
- Token usage optimization
- Response time improvements

### Error Recovery
- Graceful degradation for partial failures
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Better error messages and debugging info

## 9. Production Readiness
