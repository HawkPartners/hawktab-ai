## Entry 1 - 22:43:22.891

**Action**: `add`

[4 items, normalizedType: categorical_select]. This is a multi-item categorical grid where each of the 4 treatments has 2 possible response values (1-2). Decision: Use frequency tables (categorical_select -> frequency). Expected rows = 4 items * 2 values = 8 rows. Split needed? No (8 <= 20). Therefore produce one frequency table with 8 rows: for each item, two rows (filterValue "1" and "2"). No hints apply (not ranking, not 5- or 7-point scale). Confidence high.

## Entry 2 - 22:43:40.896

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "10 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid (percent estimates 0-100) with two columns per treatment (In addition to statin; Without a statin) across 5 treatments (Leqvio, Praluent, Repatha, Zetia, Nexletol)."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows because normalizedType == numeric_range. Expected rows: 10 (one per numeric item). Split needed: no (10 <= 20). Tables: Single mean_rows table listing all 10 items as rows. filterValue for each row is empty string. Hints: none (not a categorical scale or ranking)."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - Clear mapping: all items numeric_range and row count within limit."

---

## Entry 3 - 22:44:12.643

**Action**: `add`

[10 items, normalizedType: numeric_range]. This is a numeric grid / set of numeric percentage items (0-100) asking for percent of NEXT 100 patients. DECISION: Using mean_rows because normalizedType is numeric_range. Expected rows: 10 (one per item). Split needed: no (10 <= 20). Tables: Single mean_rows table with 10 rows, each row is one variable with filterValue "". Hints: none. CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - clear mapping, numeric percentage variables.

---

## Entry 4 - 22:45:49.794

**Action**: `add`

[8 items, normalizedType: numeric_range]. This is a numeric grid (percentages 0-100) where each item asks for percentage coverage by insurance type.

DECISION: Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 8. Split needed: no (8 <= 20). Tables: Single mean_rows table listing each of the 8 items as a separate row, filterValue empty for each.

CONFIDENCE: 0.96 - All items are numeric_range (percent values), clear mapping to mean_rows; row count well under limit.

---

## Entry 5 - 22:45:59.027

**Action**: `add`

[5 items, normalizedType: binary_flag]. This is a multi-select (each item is 0/1).

DECISION: Using frequency table with filterValue "1" for each item. Expected rows: 5 (5 items x 1 value each). Split needed: no (5 <= 20). Tables: single frequency table listing each item with filterValue "1".

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - Straightforward mapping: all items are binary_flag multi-select; one frequency table is appropriate.

---

## Entry 6 - 22:46:33.607

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "1 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical question with 2 response values (binary choice)."

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 2 (one per response value). Split needed: no. Tables: one table with two rows: CARD (1) and NEPH/ENDO/LIP (2)."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - Clear mapping: categorical question with two values; standard frequency table appropriate."

---

## Entry 7 - 22:46:58.704

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "[1] items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical variable with 6 discrete named values (CARD ON-LIST, CARD OFF-LIST, PCP ON-LIST, PCP OFF-LIST, NPPA ON-LIST, NPPA OFF-LIST)."

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 6 (one row per value). Split needed: no (6 <= 20). Tables: One frequency table with 6 rows, each row filters on qON_LIST_OFF_LIST = '1'..'6' and uses corresponding label. Hints: none (not a scale or ranking)."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - clear single categorical_select with 6 values, straightforward frequency table."

---

## Entry 8 - 22:47:25.910

**Action**: `add`

[1] items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a single numeric (continuous) question representing years in practice.

DECISION: Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 1. Split needed: no (1 <= 20). Tables: One mean_rows table with a single row for variable S6 (filterValue empty).

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - numeric_range clearly maps to mean_rows; single item, no splitting.

---

## Entry 9 - 22:47:31.936

**Action**: `add`

[1] items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical (binary) question with values 1=Full-Time, 2=Part-Time.

DECISION: Using frequency. Expected rows: 2 (1 item x 2 values). Split needed: no. Tables: One frequency table with two rows: Full-Time (filterValue="1"), Part-Time (filterValue="2").

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - Clear mapping: categorical with two values; straightforward frequency table.

---

## Entry 10 - 22:47:38.982

**Action**: `add`

[1] items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical question with 8 response values (1-8).

DECISION: Using frequency. Expected rows: 1 item * 8 values = 8 rows. Split needed: no (8 <= 20). Tables: Single frequency table with one row per response value (filterValue set to each value code).

HINTS: Not a ranking, not a 5- or 7-point scale. hints: [].

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - clear categorical mapping, simple table under 20 rows.

---

## Entry 11 - 22:47:53.822

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "1 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a single numeric question (numeric_range) representing a count (0-999)."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 1 (one row per numeric variable). Split needed: no. Tables: Single mean_rows table with one row for variable 'S11'."

CONFIDENCE: "0.96 - Straightforward mapping: numeric_range -> mean_rows, only one item, no splitting required."

---

## Entry 12 - 22:48:01.410

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "1 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single-choice categorical question with 3 response options."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - Straightforward categorical mapping; values 1-3, under 20 rows."

---

## Entry 13 - 22:48:23.895

**Action**: `add`

[1] items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical variable with 53 possible values (US states + other + invalid).

DECISION: Using frequency table. Expected rows: 1 item x 53 values = 53 rows. Split needed: yes (max 20 rows per table).

Split plan: Create 3 frequency tables splitting the 53 values into chunks of 20, 20, and 13 rows to respect the 20-row limit. No hints apply (not a scale or ranking).

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - mapping is straightforward: categorical variable with many levels requiring splitting.

---

## Entry 14 - 22:48:39.032

**Action**: `add`

[1] items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical question with 6 allowed values (Northeast, South, Midwest, West, Other, Invalid Region).

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - Direct mapping from normalizedType categorical_select to a frequency table; unambiguous labels and allowed values.
