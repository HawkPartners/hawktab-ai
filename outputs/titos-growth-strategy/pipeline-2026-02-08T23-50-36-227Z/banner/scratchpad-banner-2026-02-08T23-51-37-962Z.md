**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - VISUAL PATTERN RECOGNITION:
This banner uses shaded/merged header rows and bolded group labels to indicate group boundaries. Identified patterns: shaded rows spanning the columns for group headers ("Needs State" and "Location"), rows beneath with regular formatting containing both label and filter expression, and consistent two-column layout (label on left, filter on right).

ENTRY 2 - GROUP MAPPING:
Group: Needs State → columns: Connection / Belonging (S10a=1 OR S11a=1), Status / Image (S10a=2 OR S11a=2), Exploration / Discovery (S10a=3 OR S11a=3), Celebration (S10a=4 OR S11a=4), Indulgence (S10a=5 OR S11a=5), Escape / Relief (S10a=6 OR S11a=6), Performance (S10a=7 OR S11a=7), Tradition (S10a=8 OR S11a=8)
Group: Location → columns: Own Home (Assigned S9_1), Others' Home (Assigned S9_2), Work / Office (Assigned S9_3), College Dorm (Assigned S9_4), Dining (Assigned S9_5 OR S9_6 OR S9_7), Bar / Nightclub (Assigned S9_8 OR S9_9 OR S9_10 OR S9_11), Hotel / Motel (Assigned S9_12), Recreation / Entertainment / Concession (Assigned S9_13 OR S9_14), Outdoor Gathering (Assigned S9_15), Airport / Transit Location (Assigned S9_16), Other (Assigned S9_99)

ENTRY 3 - VALIDATION CHECKPOINT:
Validation: 2 groups mapped → 2 groups in output. Similar groups kept separate: yes. Single variable not split: yes.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.92 because group headers are visually distinct (shaded rows), filter expressions are clearly present for each column, and there are no ambiguous placeholders; extraction is straightforward.
