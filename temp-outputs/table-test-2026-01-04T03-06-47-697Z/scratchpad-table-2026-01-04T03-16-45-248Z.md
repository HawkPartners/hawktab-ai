## Entry 1 - 21:06:53.507

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S5 has 7 items. NormalizedType: binary_flag for all items. Dimensionality: 1D list of binary options (multi-select style). This is a checklist where each item is a separate 0/1 variable indicating whether respondent or family member is employed/affiliated. 'None of these' is included as item S5r7.

Interpretation: Multi-select question represented as separate binary_flag columns. Each column is independent; respondent can select multiple. Typical tables: multi_select table summarizing % selected for each option. Frequencies for 1 state (selected=1) are used; also may want frequencies for 0 (not selected) but multi_select tableType uses filterValue '1'. Also create frequency tables per item? But multi_select is appropriate—one row per option showing % selected. Also might create a 'None of these' cross-check: if S5r7=1, others should be 0; could show a QA table of combinations but unnecessary.

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'multi_select'. Will generate 1 table containing 7 rows, one per option, filterValue '1' for each row (selected state). Also consider making frequency tables for '0' (not selected) - generally analysts want percent selected and percent not selected; but multi_select captures selected; column cuts elsewhere can show base. We can include an alternative frequency table showing counts for both 1 and 0 using frequency tableType per item, but that would be 7 separate tables and redundant. Better to include main multi_select and suggest optional frequency tables per item if needed.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: Present separate frequency tables for each item (7 tables) to show distribution 0 vs 1; or create a small summary showing mean_rows since binary variables' means equal proportion selected - could use mean_rows to show proportion selected per item (treat as numeric items). So generate an additional 'mean_rows' table option as alternative: rows per item showing mean (proportion selected). That is useful when analysts want direct percentages/numeric. So produce two tables: primary multi_select (rows with filterValue '1') and secondary mean_rows (rows per item, filterValue empty). That covers both typical needs.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is clear: binary_flag -> multi_select standard. Including mean_rows is common alternative; labels and variables straightforward; 'None of these' included as its own binary variable.

Ensure filterValue for multi_select rows is '1'. Row labels accurate.

Now prepare final JSON output with questionId, text, tables array (two tables), confidence, reasoning.

Table IDs: use 's5_multi' and 's5_mean'. Table titles: 'S5 - Employment/affiliation (selected=1) - multi-select' and 'S5 - Employment/affiliation (mean/proportion selected)'. Rows: each variable S5r1..S5r7 with labels. filterValue for multi_select '1'; for mean_rows filterValue empty string.

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: "Question S12 has 4 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range for each item. Dimensionality: 1D (a list of numeric items). This looks like a set of numeric count items capturing counts of patients with events in four time windows (Over 5 years ago; Within last 3-5 years; Within last 1-2 years; Within last year)."



---

## Entry 3 - 21:07:21.209

**Action**: `add`

Consider how analysts will want to see data: For numeric_range items, typical tables are mean_rows (means, medians, std dev) per item, and distributions of counts (maybe grouped into bins) or totals/sums across respondents. So primary tableType: mean_rows showing summary statistics per time-window (rows). Also consider frequency-like distribution: counts by value would be high cardinality (0-999) so not practical to show all values; instead often create bins (0,1,2-4,5-9,10+). But binning isn't specified to create; however, we can suggest capability: create a grid_by_value style if there were pre-defined bins. There is no multi-select or ranking. Multi tables: per-respondent sums? Possibly a derived total of events across windows; but not in data. So produce main mean_rows table and suggest optional frequency tables with predefined bins if analysts want distribution. Also consider table showing percent of respondents reporting zero vs >0 (binary indicator) — that would be multi_select-like, but better to propose a frequency table for derived variable 'any_event' (0/1). We'll propose additional tables: 1) mean_rows with rows for S12r1..r4; 2) frequency table for 'zero vs nonzero' per item (one table per item or combined?). The tableType 'frequency' expects filterValue values; for derived binary we can use '1' for selected; but variables are not binary originally. The catalog includes multi_select for binary subs. We can label an option: generate binary 'Has any' derived variables and present as frequency (filterValue '1'). For now produce 1) mean_rows table and 2) four frequency tables (one per item) showing distribution across bins — but frequency table requires filterValue codes from scaleLabels; here none. So instead use 'multi_select' with filterValue '1' for derived '>=1' counts. That matches multi_select semantics: binary subs (0/1), one row per option, filterValue always '1'. So create derived rows: S12r1_any (>=1) etc. Third, suggest aggregated sum across windows as an additional mean_rows row: 'Total events (sum of 4 items)' — derived variable. Also consider table showing medians and percentiles; mean_rows may imply numeric summary. Provide several rows for these derived metrics? But table structure allows rows per variable; it's acceptable to include derived total and any-event flags? The tableType for binary derived flags should be 'multi_select' with filterValue '1'. But the initial tables array should include separate tables. We'll generate 3 tables: A mean_rows with the four items + derived total; B multi_select table with four rows indicating percent with >=1 per window (filterValue '1'); C frequency suggestion: if analyst wants value distribution, use grid_by_value is unsuitable; instead we could recommend bin frequency tables but we must output table definitions only per template. Let's include an optional table: frequency tables by binned ranges — but frequency requires filterValue codes; cannot enumerates codes. However we can propose a grid_by_value? grid_by_value is

## Entry 4 - 21:07:24.274

**Action**: `add`

Continue: grid_by_value is for N items × M values, one table per value. If we create bins as values, we could create a grid_by_value per bin. But since bins are not defined in input, mark this as optional and describe in reasoning. So final plan: generate two concrete tables (mean_rows and multi_select for >=1) plus one optional table definition template for binned frequency using grid_by_value with placeholder filterValues to be filled when bins are defined. Confidence ~0.92 because types are clear (numeric counts) and standard summaries apply.

---

## Entry 5 - 21:07:26.304

**Action**: `review`

Now prepare final JSON with questionId S12, questionText, tables array with 3 tables: - tableId 's12_summary' mean_rows with rows for S12r1..S12r4 and derived 'S12_total' - tableId 's12_any_event' multi_select with rows for derived binary S12r1_any..S12r4_any filterValue '1' - tableId 's12_binned_dist' grid_by_value as optional template with rows for S12r1..r4 and filterValue placeholders like 'BIN_1','BIN_2',... but filterValue must be string; include explanation in reasoning that bins to be defined. Confidence 0.92. Ensure labels match item labels. Done.

## Entry 6 - 21:08:03.443

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A3 has 7 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range for all items. Dimensionality: 1D list (seven numeric items). This looks like a set of numeric counts (0-100) representing, for each therapy, the number of patients (out of the last 100 uncontrolled LDL-C patients) for whom the respondent prescribed that therapy.

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' as primary. Will generate 1 main table showing mean (and other summary stats can be derived) per therapy. Also choose tableType 'ranking' to provide a quick ordered view by average usage. Will generate 1 ranking table.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: show median or percent distributions (e.g., percent of last 100) — these would be additional summary metrics but are handled in analysis layer, not by tableType options. Could also present as percent of 100 by converting to percent; alternative table: mean_rows_pct (not formal) — but unnecessary duplication. Generating additional tables: No — two tables (mean_rows + ranking) suffice; they provide both absolute average use and relative ordering.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because all items are the same numeric_range (clear mapping) and the domain (counts out of 100) strongly suggests summary mean/compare views are most useful.

---

## Entry 7 - 21:08:25.321

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A3a has 10 items (5 treatments × 2 statin-status columns). NormalizedType: numeric_range for all items. Dimensionality: 2D grid (items = treatments rows; columns = statin status: 'In addition to statin' vs 'Without a statin'). Interpretation: For each treatment respondents reported a percentage (0-100) of last 100 patients who received that treatment with vs without statin.

---

## Entry 8 - 21:08:27.600

**Action**: `add`

Because values are numeric (0-100), appropriate summary is mean (and possibly median, std dev) per item/column. Use mean_rows tableType: multiple numeric items, one row per item. But because there are two columns per treatment, we can treat each column as separate numeric item or create grouped rows per treatment showing both stats. So generate mean_rows with rows for each variable (A3ar1c1, A3ar1c2, ...). Also consider grid views: grid_by_item would show distribution across value ranges but numeric continuous; grid_by_value isn't appropriate. Multi_select and frequency and ranking not appropriate.

---

## Entry 9 - 21:08:29.404

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'mean_rows'. Will generate 1 table with 10 rows (one for each numeric variable) and an alternative grouped table that groups rows per treatment (5 groups with two rows each) for readability. Also create an alternative 'by treatment' small tables: a table per treatment showing the two columns as rows (grid_by_item could be used but since only two numeric items per treatment, mean_rows per treatment may be enough). Will generate: (A) Main mean_rows table with all 10 variables labelled clearly. (B) Five separate mean_rows tables, one per treatment, each with two rows (In addition to statin; Without a statin) to facilitate treatment-focused view.

---

## Entry 10 - 21:08:31.696

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: Use grid_by_item to produce 5 tables (one per treatment) showing distribution across binned percentages (e.g., 0-10, 11-20...) but since original data is numeric_range 0-100, distribution tables require binning decisions; leave optional. Also present summary difference (In addition to statin minus Without a statin) as computed metric per treatment — not part of tableType catalog but recommend as derived column. Generating additional tables: yes — produce per-treatment tables for readability and a grouped table. Provide both single comprehensive table and per-treatment tables.

---

## Entry 11 - 21:08:32.879

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because mapping is clear: numeric continuous 0-100 for two conditions per treatment; mean_rows is standard for multiple numeric items. Slight ambiguity around whether analysts want grouped layout or separate tables so provided both.

---

## Entry 12 - 21:09:38.572

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A4a has 10 items. NormalizedType: all items are 'numeric_range'. Dimensionality: 2D grid: items × 2 columns per item (c1 = 'in addition to a statin'?, c2 = 'without a statin'?). This looks like treatments (rows) by prescribing context (columns). Each treatment has two numeric percentage responses (0-100). Treatments: Leqvio (A4ar1), Praluent (A4ar2), Repatha (A4ar3), Zetia (A4ar4), Nexletol/Nexlizet (A4ar5). For each treatment there are two columns c1 and c2, so 5 treatments × 2 conditions = 10 items. Dimensionality: 2D (items × conditions).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' for a summary table showing mean (and possibly median/SD) percent prescribing per treatment with separate columns for 'with statin' and 'without statin'. Will generate 1 table that lists each treatment as a row and two numeric columns (With statin, Without statin). Also generate alternative views as grid_by_item or grid_by_value? The catalog: grid_by_item is grid showing one table per item, where rows are value codes — not applicable because numeric ranges continuous. grid_by_value is for N items × M values, one table per value — could be used to produce separate tables for 'with statin' and 'without statin' (i.e., two tables), each table lists 5 treatments and shows distribution across percentage bins — but because values 0-100 continuous, frequency distribution needs binning; not specified. The most appropriate is mean_rows.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: produce two tables (grid_by_value) - one table for c1 and one for c2 showing the 5 treatments as rows and percentage distribution across pre-defined ranges (e.g., mean, median, or percentiles). Or produce 'mean_rows' with additional table 'mean_rows - by condition' i.e., split into two tables each focusing on one condition (but that's redundant). Also could present 'by treatment' tables (grid_by_item) — one table per treatment with two rows (with vs without statin) showing mean — but better to keep treatments as rows for easy brand comparisons. Generating additional tables: yes — include both a combined mean_rows table and two separate mean_rows-by-condition views (flip) or grid_by_item (one table per treatment) for detailed per-treatment view.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because the mapping is clear: numeric_range continuous percentages, structure is clearly 5 treatments × 2 conditions, and summarization via means (mean_rows) is standard for percent-of-100 questions.

---

## Entry 13 - 21:10:13.963

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A4b has 10 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range for all items (values 0-100). Dimensionality: 2D (5 treatments × 2 columns). Interpretation: There are 5 treatments (Leqvio, Praluent, Repatha, Zetia, Nexletol), each with two numeric percentage responses (c1 and c2) representing two conditions/columns (labels c1/c2 not fully specified).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Primary table type will be mean_rows (multiple numeric items). Will generate multiple tables: 
- Two tables split by column (c1 and c2) showing 5 treatment rows each.
- One table listing all 10 items (one row per item) for a full view.
- Five treatment-level tables (one per treatment) showing the two columns as rows (useful for comparing c1 vs c2 within treatment).

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: could use grid_by_item (one table per treatment with the two columns as columns), or grid_by_value (one table per column showing distribution across treatments). I opted for mean_rows for numeric averages because it maps directly to mean/median metrics analysts commonly compute for percentage allocations. Generated additional tables (yes) to support both cross-treatment and within-treatment comparisons.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.86 because the numeric structure and 5×2 layout is clear and the choice of mean_rows is straightforward; some ambiguity about what c1 vs c2 represent (labels missing) so multiple views are offered to accommodate analyst needs.

## Entry 14 - 21:10:45.498

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A6 has 8 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select (values 1-4). Dimensionality: items × rank values = 2D (8 items by 4 possible rank codes). This looks like a ranking question where each item can be assigned a rank (1-4). Visual: rows=items, columns=rank values (1,2,3,4).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'ranking' as primary to show ranking results (one row per item summarizing rank distribution/positions). Will generate 1 ranking table.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Also generate 'grid_by_value' tables (one table per rank value 1-4) to show distribution of items that received each rank — useful for seeing top choices (rank 1) and other ranks. Will generate 4 grid_by_value tables (rank 1,2,3,4).

ENTRY 4 - ADDITIONAL: Generate 'mean_rows' table to show mean rank per item (numeric summary) — helpful for ordering items by average rank. Will generate 1 mean_rows table.

ENTRY 5 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because the question is a clear ranking construct (items assigned rank codes 1-4); table types chosen (ranking, grid_by_value, mean_rows) are standard for rank data and provide complementary views.


---

## Entry 15 - 21:11:07.737

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A7 has 5 items. NormalizedType: binary_flag for all items. Dimensionality: 1D list of binary indicators (multi-select checkbox). This looks like a multi-select question where respondents could select any of the 5 options (including 'Other'). Each item is stored as a separate binary flag column (A7r1...A7r5).

---

## Entry 16 - 21:11:09.246

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'multi_select'. Will generate 1 table (a multi-select frequency table) listing each option as a row with counts/percent selecting (filterValue = '1' for selected). Additionally consider providing a 'multi_select - with open text' optional view if open-text exists for 'Other (Specify)' but that text variable not provided here. So primary table: one row per option showing percent selected. Also offer a complementary frequency table of raw counts and percent of respondents selecting none? But not necessary; focus on standard multi_select view.

---

## Entry 17 - 21:11:10.943

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: Not applicable because items are binary per option; no natural 2D/3D. Could also present as separate frequency tables per item (one table per item showing selected vs not selected), but that is redundant. Generating additional tables: no, except recommend analysts may want a 'co-occurrence / cross-tab' matrix (how options were selected together) — that's a different analysis (pairwise phi or count) and not generated here by default. Also recommend providing the 'Other' verbatim text linked to A7r5 if available.

---

## Entry 18 - 21:11:12.299

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because normalizedType clearly indicates binary_flag for all items; semantics match a multi-select checkbox; standard practice is to use 'multi_select' tableType with filterValue '1' for selected state. No ambiguity.

---

## Entry 19 - 21:11:37.172

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A8 has 15 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select for all cells (values 1-5). Dimensionality: 2D (5 patient situations × 3 therapies). This is a 5 (rows: patient situations) × 3 (columns: therapies) grid; each cell is a Likert-style categorical response (1-5).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Primary table types: grid_by_item (to create one table per patient situation showing therapies as rows and response categories as columns) and mean_rows (to show mean likelihoods for all 15 cells). Will generate multiple tables: 5 grid_by_item tables (one per patient situation), 3 grid_by_item tables (one per therapy, showing patient situations as rows), and 1 mean_rows table containing all 15 items — total 9 tables.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options include grid_by_value (one table per response value showing items × therapies), or separate frequency tables per individual variable. I am generating both primary orientations (by patient situation and by therapy) plus means to cover common analyst needs.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because the grid structure is clear from variable names (rXcY), Likert scale 1-5 is explicit, and standard cross-tab views are unambiguous. Some minor ambiguity in exact tableType semantics exists but choices map cleanly to analyst requirements.

---

## Entry 20 - 21:12:12.898

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A9 has 3 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select for each item. Dimensionality: 2D (items × response values). This looks like a small grid: rows = items (Repatha, Praluent, Leqvio), columns = response codes 1–4 (extent of issues encountered).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'grid_by_item' as primary to produce one table with items as rows and distribution across values as columns. Will also generate three 'frequency' tables (one per item) as alternate/detail views.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: 'grid_by_value' producing 4 separate tables (one per response value) with items as rows; or generate four tables showing percent selecting each response per item. Generating additional tables: yes — include individual frequency tables so analysts can inspect raw distributions and to support tools that expect single-variable frequency tables.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.86 because the mapping from multi-item categorical to an items×values grid is standard and clear, but the tableType catalog labels have some overlap/ambiguity, so I provide both the consolidated grid and per-item frequency tables.

---

## Entry 21 - 21:13:03.650

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question B5 has 5 items. NormalizedType: binary_flag for each item. Dimensionality: 1D (a list of binary flags / multi-select). This looks like a multi-select checkbox question where each item is a separate 0/1 indicator (respondent may check multiple specialties).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'multi_select'. Will generate 1 table. One row per option (B5r1..B5r5) showing percent/count who selected that option (filterValue = '1').

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other possible views: create individual frequency tables for each item (equivalent to multi_select rows), or create a set of frequency tables splitting by value '0' (not selected) if needed. Also could present as a stacked bar (distribution of selections) or show co-selection matrix (pairwise correlations) — but co-selection is beyond standard crosstab and handled elsewhere. Generating additional tables: no, because multi_select covers typical analyst needs; however recommend analysts request pairwise co-occurrence if desired.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is straightforward: binary_flag -> multi_select; allowedValues are 0/1 and labels are clear.

---

## Entry 22 - 21:13:10.550

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S1 has 1 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single categorical question with three mutually exclusive response options (proceed but protect identity; proceed and allow contact details to be passed; do not want to proceed).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table showing distribution across the three response categories.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: Not applicable — single item, no multi-dimensional structure. Could consider combining into binary (proceed vs not proceed) for specific analyses: e.g., combine values 1+2 as 'willing to proceed' vs 3 'do not want to proceed'. Generating additional tables: yes — recommend a derived binary frequency table as optional view for quick interpretation.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is straightforward: single categorical variable with clear scale labels and no ambiguity.

---

## Entry 23 - 21:13:18.294

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S2b has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D list. This is a single-choice categorical question (primary role) with allowed values 1,2,3,99 and scaleLabels mapping codes to role labels.

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table. Each row corresponds to one answer option. filterValue should equal the code from scaleLabels as string.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: No 2D slicing needed. Alternative could be to produce a 'multi_select' if question had multiple selections, but it's single-select. No need for mean_rows etc. Generating additional tables: no.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is straightforward: single categorical single item with clear labels and codes.

---

## Entry 24 - 21:13:25.000

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S2 has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single-choice categorical question listing primary specialty options (including Other=99).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table. Each row will be the same variable (S2) filtered to a specific value code so analysts can see counts/percentages for each specialty.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: None needed — single categorical variable best shown as a frequency distribution. Could also show as multi_select if respondents could pick multiple specialties, but normalizedType indicates single-select.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.96 because mapping is direct: single categorical variable with defined scaleLabels and standard use is frequency table.

---

## Entry 25 - 21:13:48.919

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S3a has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single categorical question asking respondents to choose one cardiologist type from 3 options.

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table showing distribution of responses across the 3 categories.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: not applicable (single variable). Could create separate binary rows (multi_select style) but question is single-select so not appropriate. Generating additional tables: no (not needed).

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.96 because mapping is direct: single categorical variable with clear scale labels and values; no ambiguity.

---

## Entry 26 - 21:13:57.203

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question qTYPE_OF_CARD has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single-choice categorical question with three exclusive response categories (codes 1-3).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table showing distribution of responses across the three categories.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: none needed — single variable. Could produce percent or count breakdowns by demographic column cuts (handled elsewhere). Generating additional tables: no, not necessary.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is straightforward (single categorical variable) and scaleLabels provide clear codes and labels.

---

## Entry 27 - 21:14:04.891

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question qON_LIST_OFF_LIST has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This is a single categorical variable with 6 discrete values representing ON-LIST/OFF-LIST by type (CARD, PCP, NPPA).

---

## Entry 28 - 21:14:06.270

**Action**: `add`

Decision: Choose tableType 'frequency' because normalizedType categorical_select maps to frequency table: distribution of responses across the 6 categories. Will generate 1 frequency table showing counts and percentages for each scaleLabel value. filterValue for each row should be the code as string ("1".."6").

---

## Entry 29 - 21:14:08.111

**Action**: `add`

Alternatives: Could consider splitting into two derived variables ON vs OFF aggregated across types (CARD/PCP/NPPA) — e.g., create binary flags for ON vs OFF or show counts by type (CARD/PCP/NPPA) in separate frequency tables. Also could show a 3x2 table (Type x On/Off) by recoding value into Type (CARD/PCP/NPPA) as rows and On/Off as columns; but column cuts handled elsewhere, so recommend providing main frequency table plus note that analysts may want a recode. Generating additional tables: No (only main frequency) but include suggestion in reasoning. 

---

## Entry 30 - 21:14:10.023

**Action**: `add`

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because it's a straightforward single categorical variable with clear scaleLabels and no ambiguous structure.

---

## Entry 31 - 21:14:17.082

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question qLIST_TIER has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This is a single categorical variable with four mutually exclusive categories (TIER 1..TIER 4).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table showing distribution of qLIST_TIER across its 4 categories.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: none needed for a single categorical variable. Could create a 'top-box' or combine tiers but that's derived and handled later. Generating additional tables: no.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is direct and unambiguous (single categorical variable with explicit labels).

---

## Entry 32 - 21:14:21.594

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question qLIST_PRIORITY_ACCOUNT has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D (single categorical variable). This looks like a simple binary categorical question with allowed values 1(PRIORITY) and 2(NOT PRIORITY).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: No 2D+ structure, so no additional slicing needed. Could also present as percentage distribution. No multi_select or mean_rows appropriate.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is straightforward: one categorical variable with clear labels and two values.

---

## Entry 33 - 21:14:27.869

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S4 has 1 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single categorical question with three mutually exclusive responses (Board Eligible; Board Certified; Neither).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table (one frequency distribution for S4) with one row per answer option (3 rows).

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: None necessary — single categorical variable should be shown as a frequency distribution. Could also show as percent/valid percent/cumulative percent, but that is formatting handled elsewhere. Generating additional tables: no, because there are no additional dimensions to slice by.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is direct: categorical_select with explicit scaleLabels and three allowedValues; standard practice is a frequency table.

## Entry 34 - 21:14:35.147

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S6 has 1 item. NormalizedType: numeric_range. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single continuous numeric variable capturing years in practice (0-99).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'mean_rows'. Will generate 1 table summarizing the numeric variable (mean, median, std, counts). One row for the item.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Could also provide a frequency/distribution table (binned) to show counts by year ranges (e.g., 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15+). However, frequency requires categorical labels and binning rules; that's a secondary view and may be implemented downstream. Generating additional tables: no (but recommend implementing a binned frequency distribution as a secondary output).

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because the variable is clearly numeric (years) and standard practice is to present summary statistics in crosstabs; no ambiguity about dimensionality.

## Entry 35 - 21:14:43.336

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S7 has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single categorical variable with two response options (Full-Time, Part-Time).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table showing distribution of S7 with one row per answer option.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: none needed — no additional dimensions to slice by. Generating additional tables: no.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.96 because mapping is clear and unambiguous (single categorical variable with explicit scaleLabels).

## Entry 36 - 21:14:50.725

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S9 has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single categorical question with 8 mutually exclusive options (single-response).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table showing distribution across the 8 categories.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: None needed — it's a single categorical variable. Could create a binary multi_select-style table for each option (selected vs not), but unnecessary for typical reporting. Generating additional tables: no.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is straightforward: single categorical variable with clear labelled values and no multi-response or grid structure.

## Entry 37 - 21:15:02.840

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S10 has 1 item. NormalizedType: numeric_range. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single continuous numeric/count variable (0-999) representing number of adult patients managed per month.

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'mean_rows'. Will generate 1 table. Rationale: numeric_range best summarized with summary statistics (mean, median, SD, N) and possibly percentiles; mean_rows supports numeric item summary and is appropriate for a single numeric variable.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other useful views: (A) Distribution/frequency table using binned ranges (e.g., 0, 1-9, 10-24, 25-49, 50-99, 100+). This would be a frequency-style table (one variable with multiple value bins). (B) Percentile / quantile table (e.g., 10th/25th/50th/75th/90th). Generating additional tables: yes — recommend providing a binned frequency table and a percentiles table in addition to the mean_rows summary so analysts can see distribution and skew. Frequency bin labels would need to be agreed (no scaleLabels provided).

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because mapping from numeric_range to numeric summary is clear; choice of bins for distribution is a judgment call so additional distribution table is recommended but optional.

## Entry 38 - 21:15:15.479

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question S11 has 1 item. NormalizedType: numeric_range. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like an open numeric/count variable (0-999) capturing number of adult patients with hypercholesterolemia + CVD per respondent.

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'mean_rows'. Will generate 1 table summarizing distribution using summary stats (mean, median, std, min, max, base). Row will be the single numeric variable S11.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: create frequency/histogram or bucketed ranges (e.g., 0,1-5,6-10,11-20,21+) if analysts need distribution counts. Could also create percentiles table. I will NOT generate frequency rows because no scaleLabels or pre-defined bins are provided; but will note the recommendation.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is straightforward: numeric_range -> summary (mean_rows). There is minor judgment about adding bucketed frequencies, but primary table is clear.

## Entry 39 - 21:15:29.278

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A2a has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single categorical variable with 3 response options (mutually exclusive).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table that shows distribution of A2a across the 3 allowed values.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Not applicable — no 2D/3D structure to slice. Could also present as a single-row frequency with columns for each response (but column cuts are handled elsewhere). No need for grid or mean tables.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because the variable is a simple single-choice categorical with explicit scaleLabels and no structural ambiguity.

---

## Entry 40 - 21:15:36.093

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A2b has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single-choice categorical question with 3 mutually exclusive answer options (codes 1-3).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table showing distribution of responses across the three options.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: No 2D+ structure, so no alternative slicing needed. Could also present as pct and base counts; but tableType stays 'frequency'. Generating additional tables: no.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is straightforward: single categorical variable with clear scale labels and codes.

---

## Entry 41 - 21:15:42.432

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question A5 has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This is a single categorical question (one variable with 4 ordered response options about timing).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table (one frequency distribution for A5) with one row per answer option.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: none required—no multiple items or grid dimensions. Could present as percentages or mean time if coded numerically, but primary is frequency distribution. Generating additional tables: no, because only one variable.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is straightforward: single categorical variable with explicit scaleLabels; frequency table is the standard representation.

## Entry 42 - 21:15:48.533

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question US_State has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a standard single-select categorical question listing US states + Other + Invalid.

---

## Entry 43 - 21:15:49.889

**Action**: `add`

Decision: For a single categorical variable, use tableType 'frequency'. Generate one frequency table showing distribution across all allowed values (1-53). Each row should be one state label with filterValue equal to the numeric code as string. Include rows for 'Other' (52) and 'Invalid State' (53).

---

## Entry 44 - 21:15:51.285

**Action**: `add`

Alternatives: Could present grouped views (e.g., regions: Northeast, South, Midwest, West) or top-N states and 'Other states' aggregate. However grouping requires external mapping (state-to-region) not present in data; so default single-state frequency is appropriate. Could also produce a condensed table for top 10 states by frequency (post-hoc). Generating additional tables: No by default, unless user requests region grouping or top-N.

---

## Entry 45 - 21:15:52.331

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.95 because mapping is straightforward: single categorical select with explicit scaleLabels for each code. No ambiguity in tableType.

---

## Entry 46 - 21:16:09.244

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question Region has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D list. This looks like a single categorical variable with 6 possible values (Northeast, South, Midwest, West, Other, Invalid Region).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1-2 tables. Primary table: one frequency table showing distribution across all 6 codes. Secondary (optional) table: frequency excluding code 6 (Invalid Region) to show valid-region distribution.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: split by validity (valid vs invalid), or group regions into broader clusters (e.g., combine Other/Invalid). Generating additional table: yes (valid-only) because analysts commonly want distributions excluding invalid/missing codes.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because mapping from categorical_select to frequency is direct and labels are explicit; generating a valid-only table is a reasonable additional view but is a judgment call.

---

## Entry 47 - 21:16:21.120

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question B3 has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single categorical question with three mutually exclusive options (Urban, Suburban, Rural).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table. One row per answer option (three rows) with filterValue set to the scale code for each label ("1","2","3").

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options are not applicable because there is only one variable. Potential alternative views: a binary split (e.g., urban vs non-urban) could be added downstream if analysts want collapsed categories, but that is a transformation rather than a native table view. Generating additional tables: no, because column cuts are handled elsewhere and the single frequency table is standard.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because the mapping is unambiguous: single categorical variable with clear labels and codes; frequency is the standard table type.

## Entry 48 - 21:16:30.616

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question B4 has 1 item. NormalizedType: numeric_range. Dimensionality: 1D. This looks like a single continuous numeric variable capturing a count (0-9999) of physicians in a practice.

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'mean_rows'. Will generate 1 table that shows summary statistics (mean, median, n, sd) for B4 by column cuts (columns handled elsewhere). Use one row: the numeric item.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: create frequency/distribution tables by binning the numeric range into categories (e.g., 0, 1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21+). That would produce frequency tables; however there are no predefined scaleLabels/codes for bins in source, so those would be custom bins and handled by analysis team. Generating additional tables: no (not automatically), but recommend analysts produce a binned frequency table or median-focused summary if distributions are skewed.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because the variable is clearly a single numeric count and the mean_rows mapping is standard; alternative frequency/binning is possible but requires custom bin definitions.

## Entry 49 - 21:16:40.645

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - STRUCTURE: Question QCONSENT has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Dimensionality: 1D. This is a single-choice categorical question (Yes/No binary).

ENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table showing distribution of responses for QCONSENT.

ENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: No alternative slicing needed. It's not multi-select or grid; a simple frequency distribution is appropriate. Could present as a percentage and count distribution; column cuts handled elsewhere.

ENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is clear (binary categorical), labels and codes provided, no ambiguity.
