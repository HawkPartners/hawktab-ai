Duration: 41.8s

SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
Datasets tested:             24
Total mean_rows tables:      233
Tables where fix changes base: 107
Tables already correct:        126

FIX DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------
Point 1: NET base = nrow(cut_data) instead of sum(!is.na(first_component))
Point 2: NET mean = mean of per-respondent row-sums instead of sum of component means
