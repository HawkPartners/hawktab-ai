## Entry 1 - 14:55:04.746

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "7 items, normalizedType: binary_flag. This is a multi-select (checkbox grid)."

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 7. Split needed: no. Tables: One frequency table with 7 rows (one per item). Each row uses filterValue = '1' to report the count/percent who answered yes."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are binary_flag (0/1); this is a standard multi-select, well-matched to the 'frequency with filterValue 1' rule."

---

## Entry 2 - 14:56:34.712

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: 7 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid: respondents entered counts (0-100) for each therapy for their last 100 patients with uncontrolled LDL-C.

DECISION: Using mean_rows (numeric summary). Expected rows: 7 (one per item). Split needed: no (7 <= 20). Tables: Single mean_rows table 'a3' containing all 7 items; each row uses the item variable and an empty filterValue (""), so downstream should compute mean, median, std dev for each.

HINTS: None (not a ranking or Likert scale).

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - All items are clearly numeric_range and small item count, so mapping is unambiguous.

---

## Entry 3 - 14:57:57.180

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "[14] items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid (two contexts: LAST 100 and NEXT 100) with 7 treatment items per context, total 14 numeric items."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows (numeric_range -> mean_rows). Expected rows: 14 (one row per numeric item). Split needed: no (14 < 20). Tables: single mean_rows table containing all 14 items. filterValue for each row: empty string ''. Hints: none (not a ranking or Likert scale)."

CONFIDENCE: "0.96 - mapping is direct (numeric_range -> mean_rows), small item count so no splitting; labels and variables taken directly from items array."

---

## Entry 4 - 14:58:18.376

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "10 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid (percentage estimates 0-100) with two columns per treatment (likely 'with statin' vs 'without statin') but each item is a separate numeric variable.

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 10 (one per numeric item). Split needed: no (10 <= 20). Tables: Single mean_rows table (tableId: A4a_mean_rows) with 10 rows, one for each variable (A4ar1c1, A4ar1c2, A4ar2c1, A4ar2c2, A4ar3c1, A4ar3c2, A4ar4c1, A4ar4c2, A4ar5c1, A4ar5c2). filterValue: "" for all rows. Hints: [] (no ranking or Likert scale).

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - clear mapping from numeric_range to mean_rows, under row limit.

---

## Entry 5 - 14:59:08.552

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "8 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a ranking question (values 1-4 for rank positions)."

DECISION: "Using frequency tables. For 8 items and 4 rank values, use Option B from the rules: one table per rank value (rank 1, rank 2, rank 3, rank 4). Expected rows per table: 8. Split needed: no (8 <= 20). Tables: 4 frequency tables named A6_rank1..A6_rank4, each with 8 rows (A6r1..A6r8) and filterValue = the rank code as string. Add hint 'ranking' to each table."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - Clear ranking structure (categorical_select with rank values), >4 items so use per-rank tables per spec."

---

## Entry 6 - 14:59:39.683

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "5 items, normalizedType: binary_flag. This is a multi-select (multiple binary_flag items - check-all-that-apply)."

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 5 (one row per item showing selection). Split needed: no (5 <= 20). Tables: One frequency table with filterValue '1' for each item. Hints: none."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are binary_flag so the multi-select frequency table mapping is unambiguous."

---

## Entry 7 - 15:00:26.479

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "15 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a 5x3 Likert grid (patient situations x therapies), each item is a 5-point Likert (values 1-5)."

DECISION: "Using frequency tables. Expected rows: 15 items * 5 values = 75 rows. Split needed: YES (>20). Since this is a grid with two dimensions (rows = patient situations, columns = therapies), split by the first dimension (rows r1..r5). This yields 5 tables, one per patient situation. Each table contains 3 items (Repatha, Praluent, Leqvio) x 5 values = 15 rows per table (<=20). Add hint 'scale-5' to each table."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - Clear mapping: categorical_select with 5 values; grid split by row keeps related therapies together and satisfies the row limit."

Notes:
- Table IDs: a8_r1 .. a8_r5
- Rows: for each therapy in the patient situation, include filterValue strings "1".."5" (one row per response value).
- No derived variables used; only original item columns referenced.

## Entry 8 - 15:01:22.499

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: 3 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a multi-item categorical grid (each item has 4 response values 1-4).

DECISION: Using frequency. Expected rows: 3 items x 4 values = 12. Split needed: no. Tables: Single frequency table listing each item/value combination (A9c1 values 1-4, A9c2 values 1-4, A9c3 values 1-4). Hints: none (not a 5- or 7-point scale, not a ranking).

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - Direct mapping from categorical_select to frequency; small number of rows so no splitting required.

---

## Entry 9 - 15:01:44.303

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "[6] items, normalizedType: binary_flag. This is a multi-select (checkbox-style) question: each item records 0/1 whether reason applies."

DECISION: "Using frequency tables. For binary_flag multi-select, per rules use frequency with filterValue \"1\" (selected). Expected rows: 6 (one per item). Split needed: no (6 <= 20). Tables: single frequency table listing each reason (A10r1..A10r6) with filterValue '1'."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are binary_flag (0/1) and form a straightforward multi-select; well under the 20-row limit; no ambiguity."

---

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "8 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid of percentage values (0-100) asking what percent of patients are covered by each insurance type."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 8 (one per item). Split needed: no (8 < 20). Tables: one table of type mean_rows with 8 rows, each row is one numeric item (filterValue = ''). Hints: none."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are numeric_range (percentage 0-100), mapping to mean_rows is unambiguous."

---

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "5 items, normalizedType: binary_flag. This is a multi-select (checkbox-style) where each item is 0/1 indicating whether respondent selected that specialty/training." 

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 5 (one per item). Split needed: no (5 <= 20). Tables: Single frequency table listing each binary item with filterValue '1' to report percent who selected each option." 

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are binary_flag and clearly represent a multi-select; mapping to a single frequency table with filterValue '1' is unambiguous."
