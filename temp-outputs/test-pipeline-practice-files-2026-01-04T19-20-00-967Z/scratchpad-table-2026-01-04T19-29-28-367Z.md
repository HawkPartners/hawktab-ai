## Entry 1 - 13:23:22.727

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "7 items, normalizedType: binary_flag. This is a multi-select (multiple binary_flag items representing options, including 'None of these')."

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 7. Split needed: no. Tables: One frequency table with 7 rows (one per item), filterValue='1' to show percent who selected each option. No hints apply."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are binary_flag (0/1), clear multi-select mapping to a single frequency table; under 20 rows so no splitting required."

---

## Entry 2 - 13:23:31.964

**Action**: `add`

[4] items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid question asking percent allocation across activities. DECISION: Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 4. Split needed: no (4 <= 20). Tables: Single mean_rows table with 4 rows: S8r1..S8r4, filterValue "" for each. Hints: none. CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - clear mapping: all items numeric_range, straightforward summary stats (mean/median/std).

## Entry 3 - 13:23:41.339

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "4 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid of counts (number of patients) by time-since-event categories."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 4 (one per numeric item). Split needed: no (4 <= 20). Tables: Single mean_rows table with 4 rows, one for each time-since-event item (S12r1..S12r4)."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are explicit numeric_range (counts 0-999), straightforward mapping to mean_rows with no ambiguity."

---

## Entry 4 - 13:23:52.418

**Action**: `add`

[4 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a grid of 4 treatments each with 2 categorical responses (values 1-2). DECISION: Using frequency. Expected rows: 4 items x 2 values = 8 rows. Split needed: no (8 <= 20). Tables: Single frequency table with 8 rows: each item has two rows for values '1' and '2'. Hints: none. CONFIDENCE: 0.96 - clear mapping from normalizedType to frequency, small number of rows, no ambiguity.

## Entry 5 - 13:24:20.994

**Action**: `add`

[10] items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid (percentages 0-100) with two columns per treatment (BEFORE, AFTER) across 5 treatments.

DECISION: Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 10 (one per item). Split needed: no (10 <= 20). Tables: single mean_rows table with 10 rows, one for each variable (A3br1c1...A3br5c2). Hints: none (not a Likert or ranking).

CONFIDENCE: 0.92 - All items are numeric_range (clear mapping), under row limit.

---

## Entry 6 - 13:24:33.046

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "14 items, normalizedType: numeric_range for all. This is a numeric grid (two columns x seven rows) where each item records a count 0-100 for how many of NEXT 100 patients would receive that treatment."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 14. Split needed: no (14 <= 20). Tables: Single mean_rows table with 14 rows, one per item/variable. filterValue = ''. Hints: [] (no scale or ranking)."

CONFIDENCE: "0.94 - All items are numeric_range and unambiguous; under row limit, no splitting required."

---

## Entry 7 - 13:25:30.625

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "5 items, normalizedType: binary_flag. This is a multi-select (multiple binary_flag items representing options)."

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 5 (one per item). Split needed: no (5 <= 20). Tables: Single frequency table for A7 with rows for each item using filterValue '1' to indicate selected. Hints: []."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - Clear mapping: all items are binary_flag (0/1) and represent a multi-select; frequency with filterValue '1' is the standard representation."

---

## Entry 8 - 13:26:13.947

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "3 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a multi-item Likert-style grid with 4 values per item (1-4)."

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 3 items x 4 values = 12 rows. Split needed: no (12 <= 20). Tables: One frequency table with 12 rows: each item repeated for filterValue 1-4."

CONFIDENCE: "0.92 - clear categorical grid mapping; fits within row limit; no scale hint because there are 4 values."

---

## Entry 9 - 13:27:26.464
