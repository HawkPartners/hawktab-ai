## Entry 1 - 08:40:34.915

**Action**: `add`

[10] items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid of percent estimates (0-100) asking % of last 100 who received therapy in addition to statin vs without statin for multiple treatments.

DECISION: Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 10. Split needed: no. Tables: one mean_rows table with 10 rows (one per item). Hints: none.

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - clear numeric mapping, straightforward.

---

## Entry 2 - 08:41:25.492

**Action**: `add`

[8 items, normalizedType: categorical_select]. This is a ranking question (respondents rank treatment paths 1-4). Using frequency tables. Expected rows if single table per item values: 8 items x 4 values = 32 rows -> exceeds 20. Per ROW LIMIT RULE for rankings with 5+ items, use Option B (one table per rank) to reduce table count. Split into 4 tables (one per rank). Each table has 8 rows (one per item) with filterValue = rank code ("1","2","3","4"). Add hint: "ranking". Confidence: 0.95 - clear ranking mapping and unambiguous splitting by rank.

## Entry 3 - 08:41:43.528

**Action**: `add`

[5] items, normalizedType: binary_flag. This is a multi-select (each item is a binary flag 0/1). DECISION: Using frequency table with filterValue="1" for each item. Expected rows: 5. Split needed: no (<=20 rows). Tables: Single frequency table with 5 rows, each row using the variable name A7r1..A7r5, labels as provided, filterValue "1" to indicate selected. Hints: [] (no scale/ranking). CONFIDENCE: 0.96 - Clear mapping: all items are binary_flag multi-select.

---

## Entry 4 - 08:42:25.782

**Action**: `add`

[3] items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a small multi-item Likert-style grid (4-point) — categorical distribution per item.

DECISION: Using frequency. Expected rows: 3 items x 4 values = 12 rows. Split needed: no (12 <= 20). Tables: Single frequency table listing each item-value combination (one row per item per value).

HINTS: No 'scale-5' or 'scale-7' since this is a 4-point scale; not a ranking question, so hints: [].

CONFIDENCE: 0.94 - Clear mapping: categorical_select -> frequency, small grid under row limit.

## Entry 5 - 08:42:46.058

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "[8] items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid (percent allocation for insurance types)."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 8 (one per item). Split needed: no. Tables: Single mean_rows table with 8 rows, one row per insurance type (filterValue = "")."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are numeric_range (0-100), clear mapping to mean_rows to report mean/median/std dev for each insurance type."

---

## Entry 6 - 08:43:11.049

**Action**: `add`

[1] items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical question with 4 allowed values (1,2,3,99).

DECISION: Using frequency. Expected rows: 4. Split needed: no (4 <= 20). Tables: One frequency table with 4 rows corresponding to the 4 allowed values. Hints: none.

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - Clear mapping: categorical_select -> frequency, few values, straightforward.

---

## Entry 7 - 08:43:25.485

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "1 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical question with 3 response values (Cardiologist; Internal Medicine/GP/Primary Care/Family Practice; Other)."

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 3 (one per allowed value). Split needed: no. Tables: Single frequency table with 3 rows mapping to values 1-3. Hints: []."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - mapping is straightforward: single categorical variable with three values, no splitting or hints required."

---

## Entry 8 - 08:43:54.979

**Action**: `add`

[1] items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical question with 6 labeled values (ON/OFF by role). Decision: Use frequency table. Expected rows: 1 item x 6 values = 6. Split needed: no (6 <= 20). Hints: none (not a Likert scale or ranking). Confidence: high.

---

## Entry 9 - 08:44:15.794

**Action**: `add`

[1] items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical question with 3 response options (Board Eligible, Board Certified, Neither).

DECISION: Using frequency. Expected rows: 3 (one per allowed value). Split needed: no (3 <= 20). Tables: Single frequency table listing the three response codes. Hints: none (not a scale or ranking).

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - straightforward categorical mapping with explicit labels and 3 values.

---

## Entry 10 - 08:44:21.756

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "1 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a single numeric variable (years in clinical practice)."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 1. Split needed: no. Tables: One mean_rows table with a single row for variable S6 to show mean, median, std dev of years in practice."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - Clear numeric_range variable, straightforward mapping to mean_rows."

---

## Entry 11 - 08:44:28.629

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "1 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical question with 2 values (Full-Time, Part-Time)."

DECISION: "Using frequency table. Expected rows: 2 (one per allowed value). Split needed: no (rows <= 20). Tables: single frequency table with two rows: Full-Time (filterValue '1'), Part-Time (filterValue '2')."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - Clear categorical mapping with only two values, no ambiguity."

---

## Entry 12 - 08:44:50.224

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: 1 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a single numeric variable (numeric_range) representing counts from 0-999 (number of adult patients with confirmed hypercholesterolemia and established CVD).

DECISION: Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 1. Split needed: no. Tables: One mean_rows table containing one row for variable S11 to report mean, median, and std dev of reported counts.

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - numeric_range clearly maps to mean_rows and there's only one item so no splitting or ambiguity.

---

## Entry 13 - 08:45:46.997

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "1 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a single categorical (Yes/No) question." 

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 2 (one per allowed value). Split needed: no. Tables: Single frequency table with two rows: Yes (1), No (2)." 

CONFIDENCE: "0.98 - Simple binary categorical question with clear labels and no ambiguity."
