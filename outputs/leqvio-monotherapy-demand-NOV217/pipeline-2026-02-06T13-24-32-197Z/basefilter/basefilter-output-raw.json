A10 includes an explicit response option (A10r6 = 'Haven't prescribed PCSK9s without a statin'), indicating the question was asked to all qualifying respondents and non-prescribers could select that option. The datamap shows A10r1–A10r6 exist as binary flags. Therefore the default base (banner cut + non-NA) is appropriate. If analysts want percentages among only those who have prescribed PCSK9s without a statin, they should apply a reporting filter (e.g., A10r6 == 0), but that is an analytic choice, not a survey-enforced skip.
