## Entry 1 - 16:07:52.388

**Action**: `add`

Question S5 has 7 items. NormalizedType: binary_flag for each sub-item. Values: 0-1 (allowedValues [0,1]) for each. This looks like a select-all-that-apply (multi-select) question where respondents mark which affiliations apply (1 = selected).

---

## Entry 2 - 16:07:54.097

**Action**: `add`

Choosing tableType 'multi_select' because each item is a binary flag indicating whether the respondent (or family member) has the listed affiliation. For multi-select we present one row per option and show count and percent of respondents who selected it (value=1). Will generate 1 table with 7 rows (one per affiliation option). Stats: ['count','percent'].

---

## Entry 3 - 16:07:55.382

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.95 because normalizedType binary_flag clearly indicates select-all-that-apply structure. No ambiguity. One potential concern: the 'None of these' item is binary like the others; display should treat it like other options but note that respondents selecting 'None of these' should not select other options; data may still contain inconsistent selections but that's a data-quality issue.

---

## Entry 4 - 16:08:04.730

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question S8 has 4 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range. Values: 0-100 for each item (rangeMin=0, rangeMax=100). This looks like respondents allocating percentages of their professional time across activities (percentage allocation across categories).

---

## Entry 5 - 16:08:06.452

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' because these are numeric percentage allocations (0-100) across multiple items; it's most informative to show average percent of time spent on each activity, plus dispersion. Stats: mean, median, sd. Will generate 1 table with 4 rows (one per activity).

---

## Entry 6 - 16:08:07.740

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.95 because normalizedType is numeric_range with 0-100 values and the question explicitly asks for percentages of time. This matches the common pattern for percentage allocation -> mean_rows. No major ambiguities.

---

## Entry 7 - 16:08:17.135

**Action**: `add`

Question S12 has 4 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range. Values: 0-999 numeric counts for each time-since-event category. This looks like numeric count fields where respondents reported how many patients experienced an event in each time window (Over 5 years ago; Within the last 3-5 years; Within the last 1-2 years; Within the last year).

---

## Entry 8 - 16:08:18.739

**Action**: `add`

Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' because items are numeric counts (numeric_range) that are best summarized with averages and dispersion across respondents to compare counts across time windows. Stats: mean, median, sd. Will generate 1 table with 4 rows (one per time-window).

---

## Entry 9 - 16:08:19.975

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.95 because normalizedType is numeric_range and question asks 'how many patients' which implies numeric counts. Summarizing with means/medians is appropriate. Minor ambiguity: could also show totals or distribution (sum across respondents) but mean_rows is standard for comparing numeric sub-items.

---

## Entry 10 - 16:08:29.790

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question A1 has 4 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Values: 1-2 for each item. This looks like a grid question with 4 treatments each coded into one of two categories (e.g., 'option 1' vs 'option 2'), with the same allowed values across all items.

---

## Entry 11 - 16:08:31.786

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'grid_by_value' because we have multiple items (treatments) sharing the same value set (1-2). This allows generating one table per value (i.e., one for value=1 and one for value=2) showing counts and percents across the four treatments. Stats: count, percent. Will generate 2 tables (one per allowed value).

---

## Entry 12 - 16:08:33.151

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.85 because the items are clearly categorical with identical allowed values, making grid_by_value a reasonable mapping. Slight uncertainty because we don't have the label definitions for values 1 and 2 (e.g., 'Approved' vs 'Not approved' or 'Indicated' vs 'Not indicated'), but structure is unambiguous.

---

## Entry 13 - 16:08:42.725

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question A3 has 7 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range for all items. Values: integers between 0 and 100 (number of patients out of last 100 for whom each therapy was prescribed). This looks like numeric count/percentage data per therapy (each item records a numeric share out of 100).

---

## Entry 14 - 16:08:45.480

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' because items are numeric ranges representing counts (out of 100) per therapy, so comparing average counts/percentages across therapies is most meaningful. Stats: mean, median, sd. Will generate 1 table with 7 rows (one per therapy).

---

## Entry 15 - 16:08:47.095

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.94 because all items are numeric_range with the same 0-100 bounds and the question explicitly asks "for how many" out of last 100, implying percentages/counts. No ambiguity that these should be summarized with means/medians. Minor consideration: could present as percentage of patients (mean percent) or raw counts (mean out of 100) but that's equivalent; labeling should clarify 'mean count out of 100' or 'mean percent'. No major concerns.

---

## Entry 16 - 16:09:03.939

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question A3a has 10 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range for all items. Values: 0-100 (percent) for each sub-item. This looks like percentage estimates (of the last 100 patients) split into two categories per treatment ("In addition to statin" vs "Without a statin"), repeated for 5 treatments (pairs c1/c2 per treatment).

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' because these are numeric percentage fields (0-100) where comparing central tendency across items/treatments is most informative. Showing means (with median and SD) will summarize the typical percent and variability across respondents for each sub-item. Stats: ["mean","median","sd"]. Will generate 1 table containing 10 rows (2 rows per treatment, 5 treatments total).

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.92 because the normalizedType (numeric_range 0-100) maps clearly to summary statistics and the question semantics ask for approximate percentages. Minor ambiguity: treatments beyond the first are not named in the provided labels, so I will label them generically as Treatment 1..5 (using the column index).

---

## Entry 17 - 16:09:17.975

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question A3b has 10 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range for all items. Values: 0-100 (percent) for each sub-item. This looks like percentage allocations — respondents provided the percent of patients who received a given therapy without a statin, split by timing (BEFORE any other lipid-lowering therapy vs AFTER trying another therapy).

---

## Entry 18 - 16:09:19.996

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' because numeric_range percent values across multiple related items are best summarized with means (and spread) to compare how often therapies are used before vs after other therapies. Stats: mean, median, sd. Will generate 1 table with 10 rows (one per variable). Alternatively could group into pairs (Before/After) per therapy, but a single mean_rows table allows direct comparison across all items; consider labeling to indicate therapy groups.

---

## Entry 19 - 16:09:21.435

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.92 because all items are numeric_range 0-100 percent allocations and the question text explicitly asks "approximately what %". Clear structure for mean_rows. Minor ambiguity: items are duplicates across multiple therapies (A3br1..r5) — ensure labels clearly reflect therapy/timepoint pairing. No other major concerns.

---

## Entry 20 - 16:09:43.067

**Action**: `add`

Question A4 has 14 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range for all items. Values: integers 0-100 representing counts (out of next 100 patients) for each treatment option, duplicated across two columns (c1 and c2). This looks like paired numeric allocations (e.g., previous/current or baseline vs future scenario) across the same set of treatments, i.e., a repeated-measures numeric grid where each treatment has two numeric variables.

---

## Entry 21 - 16:09:45.937

**Action**: `add`

Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' because items are numeric allocations (0-100) and we want to compare average counts across treatments and between the two columns (c1 vs c2). Stats: mean, median, sd. Will generate 1 table with each treatment as a row and separate columns/series for c1 and c2 variables. Alternatively could create two separate tables (one per column), but a single mean_rows with paired columns is clearer for comparison.

---

## Entry 22 - 16:09:48.175

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.91 because all items are numeric_range 0-100 representing counts out of 100, matching the pattern 'percentage/allocation' that should be summarized with means. The only ambiguity: whether to present as separate tables per column (c1/c2) or as paired columns in one table. I choose paired columns in one mean_rows table for clearer direct comparison.

---

## Entry 23 - 16:10:05.438

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question A4a has 10 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range for all items. Values: 0-100 (percent). This looks like percentage estimates (out of NEXT 100 patients) for prescribing each therapy, likely two columns per treatment (e.g., with statin vs without statin). Data are continuous percent measures, so numeric summary statistics (means, medians, sds) are appropriate.

---

## Entry 24 - 16:10:07.344

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' because items are numeric percentage estimates (0-100) representing proportions of the next 100 patients the respondent would prescribe the therapy. The goal is to compare average expected prescribing across the different therapy/timepoint combinations. Stats: mean, median, sd. Will generate 1 table with 10 rows (one per item). Table rows should use the item labels; filterValue not needed.

---

## Entry 25 - 16:10:08.582

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.92 because all items are numeric_range (0-100) clearly indicating percent estimates and the question text explicitly asks for % of NEXT 100 patients. No ambiguity about being categorical or multi-select. Minor concern: repeated identical labels may be placeholders; ensure labels correctly reflect distinct treatments/conditions in final rendering.

---

## Entry 26 - 16:10:19.507

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question A4b has 10 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range for all items. Values: 0-100 for each sub-item. This looks like percentage allocation inputs (respondents entered an approximate percent for each treatment option) — consistent with pattern: Percentage allocation across categories.

---

## Entry 27 - 16:10:21.260

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' because items are numeric_range representing percentage allocations (0-100). We should compare average percentage allocated to each treatment sub-item. Stats: mean, median, sd. Will generate 1 table with 10 rows (one per variable). FilterValue: "" for each row.

---

## Entry 28 - 16:10:22.615

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.95 because all items are numeric ranges 0-100 and the question text explicitly asks "what % ..." so mean/median/sd are appropriate summaries. Minor ambiguity: labels are identical 'Next treatment allocation' — unclear if there are meaningful distinct item labels (maybe different treatment scenarios). If available, more descriptive labels should replace generic ones.

---

## Entry 29 - 16:10:35.258

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question A6 has 8 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select for all items. Values: 1-4 for each item (allowedValues [1,2,3,4]). This looks like a ranking-style grid where respondents assign rank positions (1 through 4) to treatment path options — likely indicating top choices/rank order rather than a simple Likert agreement scale, given the question text explicitly asks respondents to "rank which treatment paths".

---

## Entry 30 - 16:10:37.419

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'grid_by_value' because we have multiple items sharing the same categorical value set (1-4) representing rank positions. For ranking questions it's useful to present one table per rank (value) to show counts/percent of items receiving each rank. Stats: count, percent. Will generate 4 tables (one for each rank value 1,2,3,4). Rows for each table will list the 8 items as rows and filterValue set to the rank being shown.

---

## Entry 31 - 16:10:40.346

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.90 because the question text explicitly states "please rank" and all items are categorical_select with identical allowedValues 1-4 consistent with ranking positions. Minor ambiguity: allowedValues only go 1-4 while there are 8 items. That suggests respondents may have been asked to pick top 4 ranks or forced to rank a subset; but presentation as grid_by_value (one table per rank 1-4) is appropriate. Note: If actually full ranking 1-8, allowedValues mismatch would change approach, but current data supports 1-4 ranks.

---

## Entry 32 - 16:10:59.320

**Action**: `add`

Entry 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question A7 has 5 items. NormalizedType: binary_flag for all items. Values: 0-1 (allowedValues [0,1]) for each sub-item. This looks like a multi-select ('select all that apply') grid where each item is a separate binary indicator of whether the respondent selected that impact.

---

## Entry 33 - 16:11:01.130

**Action**: `add`

Entry 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'multi_select' because all items are binary_flag (0/1) representing 'select all that apply' style responses. Stats: count, percent. Will generate 1 table with 5 rows (one per item) filtered to value=1 (i.e., selected). This presents how many respondents indicated each potential impact.

---

## Entry 34 - 16:11:02.703

**Action**: `add`

Entry 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.95 because the normalizedType is consistently binary_flag across all items and the question text asks 'How might ... impact your perceptions and/or prescribing?' which is a classic select-all-that-apply list of possible impacts. No ambiguity about ranking or scales. Minor ambiguity: 'Other (Specify)' is also binary_flag; if there were open-text details they are handled elsewhere.

---

## Entry 35 - 16:11:19.435

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question A8 has 15 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select for all items. Values: 1-5 for each variable (allowedValues 1..5). The item naming (A8r1c1...A8r5c3) indicates a 5x3 grid: 5 patient situations (r1..r5) x 3 therapies (c1=Repatha, c2=Praluent, c3=Leqvio). This looks like a grid question where respondents rated likelihood (ordinal 1-5) for each therapy within each patient situation.

---

## Entry 36 - 16:11:21.954

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'grid_by_value' because this is a grid with multiple items (therapies across patient situations) sharing the same response scale (1-5). The typical display for grid categorical_select with consistent allowed values is one table per value level, allowing comparison across therapies for a given response value (e.g., How many said '5 - Very likely' for each therapy across all patient situations). Stats: count, percent. Will generate 5 tables (one for each value 1 through 5). Rows in each table will be the 15 variables (or possibly grouped by patient situation with three therapies as rows). Better: for readability, each table will list the 5 patient situations as groups with 3 therapy rows each; but crosstab schema expects rows as variables, so list all 15 variables with labels combining patient situation and therapy. Will generate 5 tables.

---

## Entry 37 - 16:11:23.569

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.90 because all items are categorical_select with identical allowedValues and clear grid row/column naming (r1..r5, c1..c3). The only minor ambiguity: exact wording of each patient situation (not provided) so I must include labels using available item labels; item labels repeat therapy names but not patient situation text. I will construct row labels by combining inferred patient situation index with therapy name (e.g., Situation 1 - Repatha). If actual situation text is available elsewhere it would be better to use that.

---

## Entry 38 - 16:11:54.595

**Action**: `add`

Question A9 has 3 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Values: 1-4 for each item. This looks like a grid question with 3 drugs (Repatha, Praluent, Leqvio) each rated on a 4-point ordinal/categorical scale about extent of issues (coverage, approvals, cost).

---

## Entry 39 - 16:11:57.315

**Action**: `add`

Choosing tableType 'grid_by_value' because we have multiple items sharing the same allowedValues (1-4) and the question asks extent of issues for each drug. It's a grid-style question where it's useful to see for each response category (e.g., 'No issues' to 'Major issues') how responses distribute across drugs. Stats: count, percent. Will generate 4 tables, one per value (1,2,3,4).

---

## Entry 40 - 16:11:58.577

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.90 because normalizedType is consistent across items and clearly represents a grid-like categorical rating. Slight uncertainty if client prefers mean comparisons, but for extent-of-issues categorical distribution tables per value are standard.

---

## Entry 41 - 16:12:10.858

**Action**: `add`

Question A10 has 6 items. NormalizedType: binary_flag. Values: 0-1 for each item. This looks like a select-all-that-apply (multi-select) question where each sub-item indicates whether that reason applies to the patient.

---

## Entry 42 - 16:12:12.501

**Action**: `add`

Choosing tableType 'multi_select' because normalizedType is binary_flag for all items (0/1). Multi-select tables show one row per option filtered to value=1 (selected), reporting counts and percentages. Will generate 1 table with 6 rows (one for each reason). Stats: count, percent.

---

## Entry 43 - 16:12:13.788

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.95 because the data are clearly binary flags representing 'select all that apply' reasons. No ambiguity in normalizedType or semantics. Minor concern: the label A10r6 contains an encoded apostrophe (Haven�t) which should be 'Haven't prescribed PCSK9s without a statin' — will keep label meaning intact.

---

## Entry 44 - 16:12:22.299

**Action**: `add`

Question B1 has 8 items. NormalizedType: numeric_range. Values: 0-100 for each item. This looks like respondents allocated percentages of their current patients covered by each insurance type (a percentage allocation across categories / budget-style question).

---

## Entry 45 - 16:12:24.101

**Action**: `add`

Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' because items are numeric percentages (0-100) representing shares of patient coverage by insurance type. It's appropriate to show mean (average percentage) across respondents for each insurance type, plus median and sd. Will generate 1 table with 8 rows (one per insurance type). Stats: mean, median, sd.

---

## Entry 46 - 16:12:25.486

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.95 because the normalizedType is numeric_range with 0-100 and the question explicitly asks "What percentage... are covered by each type of insurance?" This strongly indicates continuous percentage allocation. Slight concerns: responses might not sum to 100 if respondents reported approximate values or missing categories, but display as means is still appropriate.

---

## Entry 47 - 16:12:32.937

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question B5 has 5 items. NormalizedType: binary_flag for all items. Values: 0-1 (allowedValues [0,1]) for each sub-item. This looks like a multi-select (select-all-that-apply) question where each option is stored as a separate binary indicator representing whether the respondent selected that specialty/training.

---

## Entry 48 - 16:12:34.382

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'multi_select' because the items are binary_flag indicators (0/1) representing 'select all that apply' style specialty/training options. Stats: count, percent. Will generate 1 table with one row per specialty option, filtered to value=1 (i.e., selected). Rows will list the five variables with their labels.

---

## Entry 49 - 16:12:35.731

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.95 because all items consistently use binary_flag (0/1) and labels clearly indicate specialty options. Little ambiguity. Concern: If any option actually represents a single-choice (mutually exclusive) category mis-coded as binary flags, but unlikely given pattern; still high confidence.

---

## Entry 50 - 16:12:43.341

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question S1 has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Values: discrete categorical values 1-3 with labels indicating consent preferences (proceed & protect identity; proceed & allow contact details to be passed to Drug Safety; do not proceed). This looks like a single-choice consent question (single-select categorical).

---

## Entry 51 - 16:12:45.042

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'frequency' because this is a single categorical single-select consent question. We want to show how many respondents selected each consent option. Stats: count, percent. Will generate 1 table.

---

## Entry 52 - 16:12:46.115

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.95 because the normalizedType is categorical_select and the item clearly presents mutually exclusive consent options. Minimal ambiguity.

---

## Entry 53 - 16:12:54.204

**Action**: `add`

Question S2b has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Values: valueType indicates 1-99, allowedValues present are [1,2,3,99] with scaleLabels for 1=Physician, 2=Nurse Practitioner, 3=Physician’s Assistant, 99=Other. This looks like a single-select categorical demographic question asking respondents to report their primary role.

---

## Entry 54 - 16:12:55.827

**Action**: `add`

Choosing tableType 'frequency' because this is a single categorical/select question where each answer option should be a row. Stats: count and percent. Will generate 1 table showing counts and percentages for each role option (Physician, Nurse Practitioner, Physician's Assistant, Other).

---

## Entry 55 - 16:12:57.089

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.95 because the item is a straightforward single-select categorical demographic with clearly labeled allowedValues. No ambiguity in display format. One possible minor ambiguity: value 99 labeled 'Other' might have open-text follow-up not shown here, but that doesn't change the frequency table choice.

---

## Entry 56 - 16:13:04.959

**Action**: `add`

Question S2 has 1 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Values: integer codes 1-99 with specific allowed codes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,99] and labeled categories (Cardiologist; Internal Medicine / GP / Primary Care / Family Practice; Nephrologist; Endocrinologist; Lipidologist; Nurse Practitioner; Physician's Assistant; Other). This looks like a single-select demographic question listing primary specialty options.

---

## Entry 57 - 16:13:06.602

**Action**: `add`

Choosing tableType 'frequency' because this is a single categorical (single-select) question representing respondents' primary specialty. Frequency table will list each specialty as rows and show count and percent for each. Will generate 1 table.

---

## Entry 58 - 16:13:07.708

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.95 because normalizedType is categorical_select with explicit labeled allowed values mapping clearly to specialties. Low ambiguity — it's a straightforward demographic single-select. No major concerns.

---

## Entry 59 - 16:13:17.299

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question S2a has 1 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Values: 1-3 (Cardiologist; Internal Medicine/General Practitioner/Primary Care/Family Practice; Other). This looks like a single-select categorical demographic question asking which type of doctor's office the respondent works in.

---

## Entry 60 - 16:13:18.837

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'frequency' because this is a single categorical select question with mutually exclusive options. Frequency table will show counts and percentages per option. Will generate 1 table.

---

## Entry 61 - 16:13:20.120

**Action**: `add`

ENTRY 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Confidence: 0.94 because normalizedType is categorical_select and question wording indicates a single-choice demographic classification. No ambiguity. Potential minor concern: 'Other' could be recoded but does not affect table type.

---

## Entry 62 - 16:13:28.729

**Action**: `add`

Question qCARD_SPECIALTY has 1 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Values: 1-2 mapped to 'CARD' and 'NEPH/ENDO/LIP'. This looks like a single-selection categorical question (a single demographic/segment or specialty variable).

---

## Entry 63 - 16:13:30.492

**Action**: `add`

Choosing tableType 'frequency' because this is a single categorical select variable with two categories. Frequency table will show counts and percentages for each specialty category. Will generate 1 table with two rows (CARD, NEPH/ENDO/LIP). Stats: count, percent.

---

## Entry 64 - 16:13:31.781

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.95 because the variable is clearly a single categorical select with labeled values. No ambiguity on interpretation. Concern: none; only potential is if variable encodes 'other' or missing as codes outside allowedValues, but allowedValues specified. 

---

## Entry 65 - 16:13:38.526

**Action**: `add`

Question qSPECIALTY has 1 items. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Values: allowedValues 1-3 with labels {1: CARD, 2: PCP, 3: NPPA}. This looks like a single-select categorical demographic question (one variable with three categories).

---

## Entry 66 - 16:13:41.118

**Action**: `add`

Choosing tableType 'frequency' because this is a single categorical select variable representing SPECIALTY with three mutually exclusive categories. Stats: count, percent. Will generate 1 table showing distribution across the three specialty categories.

---

## Entry 67 - 16:13:42.129

**Action**: `add`

Confidence: 0.96 because the variable is a straightforward categorical select with clear labels and no ambiguity. No concerns.

---

## Entry 68 - 16:13:51.844

**Action**: `add`

Entry 1 - DATA STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
Question S3a has 1 item. NormalizedType: categorical_select. Values: 1-3 with scaleLabels mapping 1=Interventional Cardiologist, 2=General Cardiologist, 3=Preventative Cardiologist. This looks like a single-select categorical demographic question (one variable with three mutually exclusive options).

---

## Entry 69 - 16:13:53.614

**Action**: `add`

Entry 2 - DISPLAY DECISION:
Choosing tableType 'frequency' because this is a single categorical select question (respondents choose which type of cardiologist they are). For crosstab display, one row per option with stats count and percent is appropriate. Will generate 1 table.

---

## Entry 70 - 16:13:54.862

**Action**: `add`

Entry 3 - CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
