- In this CAR T run, the banner apparently mentions to include segment solutions, but our AI continues to not, probably because it's not filled out or it's outside of the typical visual hierarchy, so we might have to change some things. But that's deferred because presumably maybe a different feature we can add to the system is being able to add cuts on demand, right? We're not going to re-generate the table for you, but we can regenerate the cuts.
