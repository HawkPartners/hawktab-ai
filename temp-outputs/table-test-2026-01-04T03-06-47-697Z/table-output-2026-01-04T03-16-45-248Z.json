Dimensionality: 1D — a list of numeric count items representing counts of patients with events within four time windows.\n\nENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' for primary summary because the items are numeric counts — analysts will want means, medians, standard deviations, N, and percentiles for each time window. Will generate 1 mean_rows table (s12_summary) containing the four original items plus a derived total (sum across windows) so analysts can see average burden per respondent.\n\nENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Analysts will also want prevalence (how many respondents report any events in each window). Since original values are counts, derive binary indicators (>=1) per item and present as multi_select (binary) tables showing percent with at least one event — implemented as s12_any_event with filterValue '1' for the selected/positive state. Distribution of raw counts is high-cardinality (0–999); useful views include binned frequency tables (e.g., 0,1,2–4,5–9,10+). Because bins are not defined in the input, I provide a template grid_by_value (s12_binned_dist_template) where bins (BIN_1, BIN_2, etc.) should be defined by the analyst; once bins are set, the platform can produce one table per bin or a grid_by_value view per bin.\n\nENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because the variable types (numeric counts) and expected analyst needs (summary stats and prevalence of any event) are clear; optional binned distributions are a standard extension but require business decisions about bin thresholds.\n\nNotes/Recommendations:\n- Implement the derived variables: S12_total = sum(S12r1..S12r4); S12rX_any = (S12rX >= 1). Include missing-value handling rules (e.g., treat blanks as zero only if appropriate).\n- When distribution by count is required, define bins before producing frequency or grid_by_value tables to avoid extremely wide tables.\n- If analysts want median and interquartile range rather than mean, ensure the reporting engine computes those in the mean_rows output.\n\nChecklist:\n- Identified dimensionality: yes (1D list)\n- filterValue correct for tableType: yes (multi_select rows use '1'; mean_rows and template use empty or placeholder)\n- For 2D+: not applicable\n- Row labels: accurate and taken from item labels.

Dimensionality: 1D (a list of independent categorical items), not a 2D grid (no r#c# naming pattern). This is a straightforward multi-item categorical list.\n\nENTRY 2 - DECISION: Primary recommended display is 'grid_by_value' (one table per response value). This produces two tables (one for value = 1 and one for value = 2), each with the four treatments as rows. This view is useful when analysts want to compare how many respondents selected a specific response across treatments side-by-side.\n\nI also provide 'grid_by_item' tables (one table per item) as a secondary/alternative view. Each item table lists the response values (1 and 2) so analysts can see the full distribution for that single treatment. This is equivalent to separate frequency tables per item but grouped in a 'grid_by_item' style as required by the table catalog.\n\nENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options considered: (a) individual frequency tables (one frequency table per item) — effectively the same as the grid_by_item set. (b) a single combined matrix with items as rows and response values as columns in one table — desirable for reporting but not explicitly a catalog tableType; the grid_by_value approach (two tables) provides the same comparison capability. Generating additional tables: no — the two sets (grid_by_value and grid_by_item) give both cross-item comparisons by response and per-item distributions.\n\nENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is clear: categorical items with two codes and standard analyst views are obvious.

Additionally provide a ranking table to quickly compare therapies by average usage.\n\nENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other useful views include medians, quartiles, or distribution histograms (e.g., percent of respondents prescribing 0, 1–10, etc.), and conversion to percent-of-100. Those are analysis-layer metrics rather than different crosstab structures; they can be produced from the mean_rows raw numeric responses.

Generated one comprehensive mean_rows table including all 10 variables for quick comparison across treatments and statin-status, plus five treatment-focused mean_rows tables (one per treatment) that show the two statin-status values together for easier treatment-level interpretation. Alternatives considered: producing binned/distribution tables (would require bin definitions) or creating derived difference columns (e.g., % with statin minus % without) — these are recommended as additional computed metrics but were not added as separate tableTypes here.

Variable names follow r#c# pattern (A3br{treatmentIndex}c{timingIndex}) indicating a 2D structure: treatments (5: Leqvio, Praluent, Repatha, Zetia, Nexletol) × timing (2: BEFORE any other therapy, AFTER trying another therapy).\n\nENTRY 2 - DECISION: Because items are numeric percentages, the primary and most useful table type is mean_rows (one row per numeric item). I generate:\n- One comprehensive table with all 10 rows (each treatment × timing) so analysts can see means for every cell at a glance.\n- Five treatment-specific tables (one per treatment) that show the two timing rows (Before vs After) — useful when product/brand is the primary comparison.\n- Two timing-specific tables (Before and After) that show all five treatments — useful when timing is the primary comparison.\n\nENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options include a single 5-row table with two numeric columns (Before and After) — this is effectively achieved by the timing-specific tables when columns are arranged by timing in the reporting tool. A heatmap-style grid (treatment × timing) could also be produced in visualization tools. I produced multiple views to cover both primary-analysis needs (by treatment and by timing) and the exhaustive single-table view.\n\nENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because the r#c# naming pattern and numeric_range type make the 2D treatment×timing interpretation unambiguous, and numeric percentages map cleanly to mean_rows. The extra table views are standard useful slices for analysts."

Each cell is a numeric_range (0–100) representing counts (or expected counts) and should be summarized with means/totals — so mean_rows is the appropriate tableType. I generated two primary tables (one per scenario) listing the seven treatments so analysts can directly compare the distribution across treatments within each scenario. I also generated seven per-treatment comparison tables (one per treatment) showing LAST vs NEXT side-by-side to highlight changes in prescribing for each treatment. This provides both row-focused and column-focused views that analysts commonly need. Confidence is high because item naming clearly indicates a 7×2 grid and all items are numeric ranges (no ambiguity about scale or categorical values)."

The primary, most useful summary is mean (and related stats) for each item, so mean_rows is appropriate. I provide: (A) a combined mean_rows table listing all 10 item-level variables (clear side-by-side comparison) and (B) five per-treatment detail mean_rows tables (each showing the two contexts) to make per-treatment comparisons/readouts easy. Alternate options (not implemented here) would be distribution tables requiring binning (grid_by_value) or one-table-per-item grids; those require value bins or different output needs. Labels map each variable to treatment + context. Confidence is high because mapping and structure are unambiguous."

Analysts will want mean/median and dispersion for these percentage allocations, so mean_rows is the appropriate tableType. I produced multiple useful views: a single table with all 10 items for a comprehensive look; two treatment-level summary tables (one per column) to compare treatments within the same column; and five per-treatment tables to compare c1 vs c2 within each treatment. This covers common slicing needs (cross-treatment and within-treatment comparisons). Slight ambiguity exists about what c1 vs c2 semantically represent (labels missing), so providing multiple slices reduces risk that analysts will need additional cuts."

Complementary views: (1) mean_rows to present mean rank (useful for ordering by average preference); (2) grid_by_value tables (one table per rank value 1–4) to show which items received each specific rank — valuable for quickly seeing top choices (rank=1) and other rank-level distributions. FilterValue for grid_by_value tables is set to the rank code (\"1\"–\"4\") as required. Confidence is high (0.95) because item naming, allowed values, and survey wording clearly indicate a ranking question; the chosen table types are standard and provide multiple useful slices for analysts."

Also provide the alternative orientation by therapy (patient situations as rows) and a mean_rows table for quick ranking/averages. Additionally include grid_by_value (one table per response value 1–5) so analysts can see prevalence of a given response level across all items. filterValue: for frequency-style/grid_by_item and grid_by_value tables the response value is handled by the table splitter elsewhere; here I set filterValue=\"1\" as the canonical code (tables will be generated once per response value 1–5).

Will generate 1 primary table showing one row per insurance type (B1r1..B1r8) with mean/median/SD/N (typical statistics for numeric items). This is the most useful default view for percentage items.\n\nENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other useful views: (a) A QC/validation row/table that reports the respondent-level sum of the 8 percentages (B1_total_pct) to check that totals approximate 100% — recommended and included as a derived mean_rows table. (b) Distribution tables (histograms) by binned percentage ranges for each item; this requires defining bins (e.g., 0,1-10,11-25,26-50,51-75,76-100) — represented here as a suggested grid_by_item view so analysts can see percent of respondents in each bin for each insurance type. Generating these additional tables: yes (suggested) because they provide diagnostic and distributional insights beyond central tendency.\n\nENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because the mapping is clear: numeric percentage items are best summarized with means/medians and dispersions; there is no ambiguity in dimensionality or primary table type. The only choices are optional derived checks and binned distributions which require explicit bin definitions but are standard practice."

Dimensionality is 1D — a single continuous/count numeric variable representing number of adult patients managed per month.\n\nENTRY 2 - DECISION: The primary table type is 'mean_rows' because numeric_range variables are best summarized with summary statistics (mean, median, SD, N). This yields one summary row for S10.\n\nENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Analysts will also want to understand the distribution because counts are often skewed. I therefore included a binned frequency table (frequency) — bins are suggested examples since no scaleLabels were provided; actual bin cutpoints can be adjusted by analysts. I also included a percentiles table (as mean_rows rows for common percentiles) to show distribution shape and extreme values.\n\nENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because mapping numeric_range to summary statistics and distribution is clear. The only judgment call is the choice of bin cutpoints for the frequency table; bins provided are sensible defaults but can be revised."

Analysts commonly also want the distribution; because no predefined bins or scaleLabels were provided, a derived-frequency view (bucketed counts) is useful for interpretation and crosstabs. I provided a sensible set of buckets (0,1–5,6–10,11–20,21–50,51+) and a missing category; these are derived and would require preprocessing to map S11 into these categories before producing the frequency table.

Because the source provides a free numeric range (no predefined categories), frequency tables require binning. I provided a recommended set of bins as a second table (frequency) for implementation by analysts; these bins are suggestions and filterValue codes are illustrative (bins must be created in analysis). If the distribution is highly skewed, median and percentiles or alternative bins should be used.\n\nENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because the mapping from a numeric count to summary statistics is unambiguous.

This is a checklist where each item is a separate 0/1 variable indicating whether respondent or family member is employed/affiliated. 'None of these' is included as item S5r7.\n\nInterpretation: Multi-select question represented as separate binary_flag columns. Each column is independent; respondent can select multiple. Typical tables: multi_select table summarizing % selected for each option. Frequencies for 1 state (selected=1) are used; also may want frequencies for 0 (not selected) but multi_select tableType uses filterValue '1'. Also create frequency tables per item? But multi_select is appropriate—one row per option showing % selected. Also might create a 'None of these' cross-check: if S5r7=1, others should be 0; could show a QA table of combinations but unnecessary.\n\nENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'multi_select'. Will generate 1 table containing 7 rows, one per option, filterValue '1' for each row (selected state). Also consider making frequency tables for '0' (not selected) - generally analysts want percent selected and percent not selected; but multi_select captures selected; column cuts elsewhere can show base. We can include an alternative frequency table showing counts for both 1 and 0 using frequency tableType per item, but that would be 7 separate tables and redundant. Better to include main multi_select and suggest optional frequency tables per item if needed.\n\nENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: Present separate frequency tables for each item (7 tables) to show distribution 0 vs 1; or create a small summary showing mean_rows since binary variables' means equal proportion selected - could use mean_rows to show proportion selected per item (treat as numeric items). So generate an additional 'mean_rows' table option as alternative: rows per item showing mean (proportion selected). That is useful when analysts want direct percentages/numeric. So produce two tables: primary multi_select (rows with filterValue '1') and secondary mean_rows (rows per item, filterValue empty). That covers both typical needs.\n\nENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because mapping is clear: binary_flag -> multi_select standard. Including mean_rows is common alternative; labels and variables straightforward; 'None of these' included as its own binary variable.\n\nEnsure filterValue for multi_select rows is '1'. Row labels accurate.\n\nNow prepare final JSON output with questionId, text, tables array (two tables), confidence, reasoning.\n\nTable IDs: use 's5_multi' and 's5_mean'. Table titles: 'S5 - Employment/affiliation (selected=1) - multi-select' and 'S5 - Employment/affiliation (mean/proportion selected)'. Rows: each variable S5r1..S5r7 with labels. filterValue for multi_select '1'; for mean_rows filterValue empty string.\n\n"

        "content": "Consider how analysts will want to see data: For numeric_range items, typical tables are mean_rows (means, medians, std dev) per item, and distributions of counts (maybe grouped into bins) or totals/sums across respondents. So primary tableType: mean_rows showing summary statistics per time-window (rows). Also consider frequency-like distribution: counts by value would be high cardinality (0-999) so not practical to show all values; instead often create bins (0,1,2-4,5-9,10+). But binning isn't specified to create; however, we can suggest capability: create a grid_by_value style if there were pre-defined bins. There is no multi-select or ranking. Multi tables: per-respondent sums? Possibly a derived total of events across windows; but not in data. So produce main mean_rows table and suggest optional frequency tables with predefined bins if analysts want distribution. Also consider table showing percent of respondents reporting zero vs >0 (binary indicator) — that would be multi_select-like, but better to propose a frequency table for derived variable 'any_event' (0/1). We'll propose additional tables: 1) mean_rows with rows for S12r1..r4; 2) frequency table for 'zero vs nonzero' per item (one table per item or combined?). The tableType 'frequency' expects filterValue values; for derived binary we can use '1' for selected; but variables are not binary originally. The catalog includes multi_select for binary subs. We can label an option: generate binary 'Has any' derived variables and present as frequency (filterValue '1'). For now produce 1) mean_rows table and 2) four frequency tables (one per item) showing distribution across bins — but frequency table requires filterValue codes from scaleLabels; here none. So instead use 'multi_select' with filterValue '1' for derived '>=1' counts. That matches multi_select semantics: binary subs (0/1), one row per option, filterValue always '1'. So create derived rows: S12r1_any (>=1) etc. Third, suggest aggregated sum across windows as an additional mean_rows row: 'Total events (sum of 4 items)' — derived variable. Also consider table showing medians and percentiles; mean_rows may imply numeric summary. Provide several rows for these derived metrics? But table structure allows rows per variable; it's acceptable to include derived total and any-event flags? The tableType for binary derived flags should be 'multi_select' with filterValue '1'. But the initial tables array should include separate tables. We'll generate 3 tables: A mean_rows with the four items + derived total; B multi_select table with four rows indicating percent with >=1 per window (filterValue '1'); C frequency suggestion: if analyst wants value distribution, use grid_by_value is unsuitable; instead we could recommend bin frequency tables but we must output table definitions only per template. Let's include an optional table: frequency tables by binned ranges — but frequency requires filterValue codes; cannot enumerates codes. However we can propose a grid_by_value? grid_by_value is "

Will generate 1-2 tables. Primary table: one frequency table showing distribution across all 6 codes. Secondary (optional) table: frequency excluding code 6 (Invalid Region) to show valid-region distribution.\n\nENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: split by validity (valid vs invalid), or group regions into broader clusters (e.g., combine Other/Invalid). Generating additional table: yes (valid-only) because analysts commonly want distributions excluding invalid/missing codes.\n\nENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because mapping from categorical_select to frequency is direct and labels are explicit; generating a valid-only table is a reasonable additional view but is a judgment call."

This looks like a single categorical question with three mutually exclusive options (Urban, Suburban, Rural).\n\nENTRY 2 - DECISION: Choosing tableType 'frequency'. Will generate 1 table. One row per answer option (three rows) with filterValue set to the scale code for each label (\"1\",\"2\",\"3\").\n\nENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options are not applicable because there is only one variable. Potential alternative views: a binary split (e.g., urban vs non-urban) could be added downstream if analysts want collapsed categories, but that is a transformation rather than a native table view. Generating additional tables: no, because column cuts are handled elsewhere and the single frequency table is standard.\n\nENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.95 because the mapping is unambiguous: single categorical variable with clear labels and codes; frequency is the standard table type."

Will generate 1 table that shows summary statistics (mean, median, n, sd) for B4 by column cuts (columns handled elsewhere). Use one row: the numeric item.\n\nENTRY 3 - ALTERNATIVES: Other slicing options: create frequency/distribution tables by binning the numeric range into categories (e.g., 0, 1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21+). That would produce frequency tables; however there are no predefined scaleLabels/codes for bins in source, so those would be custom bins and handled by analysis team. Generating additional tables: no (not automatically), but recommend analysts produce a binned frequency table or median-focused summary if distributions are skewed.\n\nENTRY 4 - CONFIDENCE: 0.92 because the variable is clearly a single numeric count and the mean_rows mapping is standard; alternative frequency/binning is possible but requires custom bin definitions."
