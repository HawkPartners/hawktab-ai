These are best summarized with location and spread to compare usage patterns across items (before vs after other lipid‑lowering therapy). A single mean_rows table with one row per variable (clearly labeled by therapy and timing) is appropriate. Minor ambiguity: only the first therapy name (Leqvio) is explicit in the question text; other therapies are labeled generically here as Therapy 2–5 to match the item structure."

This looks like paired numeric allocation variables for the same set of treatment options.\n\nDISPLAY DECISION: Choosing tableType 'mean_rows' because these are numeric allocation variables (0-100) and the most meaningful summary is central tendency (average number of patients) with dispersion to compare across treatments and between the two columns (c1 vs c2). Stats: mean, median, sd. I will generate one table that lists each treatment/column variable as a row so the analyst can directly compare c1 vs c2 values side-by-side in the crosstabing UI (rendered as separate columns/series).\n\nCONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT: Confidence: 0.91 because the numeric_range 0-100 pattern strongly matches allocation/percentage data which should be summarized with means. Minor ambiguity exists about whether to present the two columns as separate tables instead of paired rows; I selected paired rows for clearer direct comparison."
