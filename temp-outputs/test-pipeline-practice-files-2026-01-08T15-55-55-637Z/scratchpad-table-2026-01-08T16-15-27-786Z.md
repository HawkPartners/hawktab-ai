## Entry 1 - 10:00:59.650

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "7 items, normalizedType: binary_flag. This is a multi-select (checkbox) question: respondents may select any/all that apply."

DECISION: "Using frequency tables. Expected rows: 7 (one row per item showing count/% of respondents who answered '1' = selected). Split needed: no (7 < 20). Tables: Single frequency table with filterValue '1' for each item."

CONFIDENCE: "0.96 - All items are binary flags (0/1), unambiguous multi-select mapping to a frequency-of-selection table."

---

## Entry 2 - 10:01:16.015

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "[4] items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric allocation/grid question (percentages 0-100)."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 4. Split needed: no. Tables: Single mean_rows table with four rows (one per item)."

CONFIDENCE: "0.96 - All items are numeric_range (clear mapping); few items so no splitting needed."

---

## Entry 3 - 10:01:47.271

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "4 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a multi-item categorical grid (4 items x 2 response values each)."

DECISION: "Using frequency. Expected rows: 4 items x 2 values = 8 rows. Split needed: no. Tables: One frequency table listing each item's two response values (filterValue '1' and '2')."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are categorical_select with only 2 allowed values; total rows (8) < 20 so no splitting needed."

---

## Entry 4 - 10:03:24.304

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "14 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid (two columns representing 'LAST 100' and 'NEXT 100' counts but flattened into 14 numeric items)."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 14. Split needed: no (14 <= 20). Tables: One mean_rows table containing all 14 items (one row per numeric item)."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are numeric_range (0-100), unambiguous mapping to mean_rows; row count under limit."

---

## Entry 5 - 10:03:46.249

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "10 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid of percent estimates (0-100) for treatments (Leqvio, Praluent, Repatha, Zetia, Nexletol) crossed by statin vs without statin (c1 = with statin, c2 = without)."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 10 (one per numeric item). Split needed: no (10 < 20). Tables: Single mean_rows table listing all 10 numeric items; each row uses the original variable (column) and an empty filterValue. Hints: none."

## Entry 6 - 10:04:25.136

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "10 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid of percent allocations (0-100) for multiple treatments; each treatment has two columns (c1 and c2)."

DECISION: "Using mean_rows. Expected rows: 10 (one row per item). Split needed: no (10 ≤ 20). Tables: single mean_rows table listing each column item as a separate row. Hints: none (not a Likert scale or ranking)."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are clearly numeric_range (0-100); simple mean/median/std dev summaries are appropriate and under row limit."

---

## Entry 7 - 10:04:52.222

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "8 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a ranking question with 4 rank positions (1-4)."

DECISION: "Using frequency tables. Expected rows if one-per-item table (Option A): 8 items x 4 values = 32 rows > 20 so split needed. Following ranking guidance (5+ items) use Option B: one table per rank value. Create 4 tables (rank 1, rank 2, rank 3, rank 4), each with 8 rows (one row per item, filterValue equal to rank). Split needed: yes. Tables: 4 frequency tables, each showing which items received that rank position."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - Clear mapping: categorical_select ranking question with standard guidance to split by rank for >4 items; number of items and values deterministic."

## Entry 8 - 10:05:38.643

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "5 items, normalizedType: binary_flag. This is a multi-select (each item is a binary 0/1 flag)."

DECISION: "Using frequency table with filterValue = '1' for each item to show percent who selected each option. Expected rows: 5 (one per item). Split needed: no (<=20 rows). Tables: single frequency table 'a7' with 5 rows, each variable A7r1..A7r5, filterValue '1'."

## Entry 9 - 10:07:43.742

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: 6 items, normalizedType: binary_flag. This is a multi-select (multiple checkbox) question where each item is a binary flag (0/1).
