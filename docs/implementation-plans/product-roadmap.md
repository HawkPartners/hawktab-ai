## 3. Security

- Conduct another security audit after feature freeze — new API routes have been added since the last audit
- Research the risk profile specific to deployed web apps vs. mobile apps

## 4. Developer Documentation

- Revisit `CLAUDE.md` to reinforce: "follow established codebase patterns before defaulting to training-data conventions" — cover not just security but Convex patterns, API layer usage, etc.
- https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action (can use this to execute security audits and pattern checks)
- Document the three `.env` files (`.env.local`, `.env.dev`, `.env.prod`) and their purposes in both `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- Document the deployment flow: `dev` branch (feature work) → `staging` branch (Railway auto-deploys, cloud testing) → `production`
