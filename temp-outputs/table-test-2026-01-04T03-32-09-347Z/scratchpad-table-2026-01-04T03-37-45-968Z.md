## Entry 1 - 21:32:13.710

**Action**: `add`

[7 items, normalizedType: binary_flag]. This is a multi-select question (all items are binary_flag with values 0/1). DECISION: Using frequency table showing percent/count who selected each option (filterValue "1"). Primary table: single consolidated frequency table with one row per item (S5r1..S5r7) and filterValue "1" for each. Additional tables: none. CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - clear multi-select structure (binary flags) and standard analyst need is percent who selected each option.

## Entry 2 - 21:32:26.568

**Action**: `add`

[4] items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric multi-item question asking counts of patients by time-since-event categories. Decision: Using mean_rows. Primary table: single mean_rows table with all four time-since-event items as rows showing mean/median/std dev of counts. Additional tables: none. Confidence: 0.95 - clear numeric items, straightforward aggregation.

---

## Entry 3 - 21:32:39.408

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "4 items, normalizedType: categorical_select. Each item is a treatment with allowed values 1-2 (binary-like). This is a grid of categorical items (4 treatments × 2 response options).\n\nDECISION: Using frequency. Primary table: a single consolidated frequency table that lists each treatment × response option as separate rows (8 rows total). Rationale: analysts typically want the distribution of responses for each treatment; listing each variable+filterValue in one frequency table allows direct crosstabing by banner columns.\n\nAdditional tables: none.\n\nCONFIDENCE: 0.92 - clear structure (categorical items with small consistent value set)."}```

## Entry 4 - 21:33:01.084

**Action**: `add`

[10 items, normalizedType: numeric_range]. This is a numeric grid: each item is a numeric_range (0-100) representing % of patients for different treatments and timing (before/after). Items correspond to treatments × timing (5 treatments × 2 timing = 10 items). For numeric items, use tableType 'mean_rows' with one row per variable. Recommendation: consolidate into a single mean_rows table listing all 10 variables as rows. filterValue must be empty string for mean_rows. Provide descriptive labels combining treatment and timing. Confidence high (0.95) since normalizedType numeric_range clearly indicates numeric summary.

## Entry 5 - 21:33:22.333

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "10 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid of percent responses for multiple treatments (2 columns per treatment: likely 'with statin' and 'without statin').

DECISION: Using mean_rows. Primary table: Single consolidated mean_rows table with all 10 numeric items as rows, each row representing a specific treatment x condition (e.g., Leqvio with statin, Leqvio without statin, etc.). Additional tables: none.

CONFIDENCE: 0.95 - All items are numeric_range 0-100; analysts need mean/median/std for each item to compare across treatments and conditions.

---

## Entry 6 - 21:33:33.286

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "10 items, normalizedType: numeric_range. This is a numeric grid (2 columns per treatment).\n\nDECISION: Using mean_rows. Primary table: one consolidated mean_rows table with all 10 numeric items as rows (each item is a percent 0-100). Additional tables: none.\n\nCONFIDENCE: 0.92 - All items are numeric_range (0-100) so summary stats (mean/median/std) are appropriate; consolidated table preferred for analyst comparison across treatments and columns."

---

## Entry 7 - 21:33:42.161

**Action**: `add`

[8] items, normalizedType: categorical_select. This is a ranking question (respondents assign ranks 1-4 to each item). Decision: Use mean_rows to show average rank per item so analysts can compare ranking preference. Primary table: single mean_rows table with all 8 items as rows. Additional tables: none. Confidence: 0.95 - clear ranking items with standard analyst need to compare average rank.

---

## Entry 8 - 21:33:50.752

**Action**: `add`

STRUCTURE: "5 items, normalizedType: binary_flag (all). This is a multi-select question (each item binary 0/1)."

CONFIDENCE: "0.95 - All items are binary_flag (clear multi-select)."

---

## Entry 9 - 21:34:03.618

**Action**: `add`

[15 items, normalizedType: categorical_select]. This is a 5x3 Likert grid (rows = 5 patient situations, columns = 3 therapies), each item has values 1-5. Decision: Use a single consolidated frequency table showing distribution across the 1-5 response values for each of the 15 grid cells. Primary table: one frequency table with 75 rows (each variable × each allowed value as filterValue). Confidence: 0.92 - clear categorical grid, frequency distribution per item is most useful.
