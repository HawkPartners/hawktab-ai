"groupName","name","expression","confidence","reason"
"Specialty","Cards","(S2 == 1 & S2a == 1)","0.920","Both S2 and S2a exist in the data map. S2=1 maps to Cardiologist specialty, S2a=1 maps to Cardiologist office. Converted to R syntax with '==' and '&'. Multiple direct variables combined logically, high confidence."
"Specialty","PCPs","S2 == 2","0.970","S2 exists in the data map; value 2 corresponds to Internal Medicine/General Practitioner/Primary Care. Direct one-variable mapping to R syntax with '=='. High confidence."
"Specialty","Nephs","S2 == 3","0.970","S2 exists in the data map; value 3 corresponds to Nephrologist. Direct one-variable mapping to R syntax with '=='. High confidence."
"Specialty","Endos","S2 == 4","0.970","S2 exists in the data map; value 4 corresponds to Endocrinologist. Direct one-variable mapping to R syntax with '=='. High confidence."
"Specialty","Lipids","S2 == 5","0.970","S2 exists in the data map; value 5 corresponds to Lipidologist. Direct one-variable mapping to R syntax with '=='. High confidence."
"Role","HCP","S2b == 1","0.950","Original expression 'IF HCP' has no direct variable. Mapped to S2b (What is your primary role?) where 1 = Physician, interpreting HCP as physicians. Chose S2b over S2 for precise role mapping."
"Role","NP/PA","S2b %in% c(2, 3)","0.950","Original expression 'IF NP/PA' matches S2b response options 2 = Nurse Practitioner and 3 = Physician’s Assistant. Used S2b %in% c(2, 3) for combined filtering."
"Volume of Adult ASCVD Patients","Higher","(S11 >= cutoff)","0.500","Original expression is a placeholder requiring a cutoff. Mapped to S11 (count of adult patients with established CVD from data map). S10 (total adult patients) was considered but S11 specifically aligns with ASCVD. Cutoff value not provided, so a placeholder ‘cutoff’ is used; confidence reduced due to missing cutoff specification."
"Volume of Adult ASCVD Patients","Lower","(S11 < cutoff)","0.500","Original expression is a placeholder requiring a cutoff. Mapped to S11 (count of adult patients with established CVD from data map). S10 was considered but S11 better matches ASCVD. Cutoff value not provided, so a placeholder ‘cutoff’ is used; confidence reduced due to missing cutoff specification."
"Tiers","Tier 1","qLIST_TIER == 1","0.990","Mapped 'Tier 1 from list' directly to the data map variable qLIST_TIER (LIST TIER), where 1 = TIER 1. Direct, unambiguous match."
"Tiers","Tier 2","qLIST_TIER == 2","0.990","Mapped 'Tier 2 from list' directly to qLIST_TIER, where 2 = TIER 2. Direct, unambiguous match."
"Tiers","Tier 3","qLIST_TIER == 3","0.990","Mapped 'Tier 3 from list' directly to qLIST_TIER, where 3 = TIER 3. Direct, unambiguous match."
"Tiers","Tier 4","qLIST_TIER == 4","0.990","Mapped 'Tier 4 from list' directly to qLIST_TIER, where 4 = TIER 4. Direct, unambiguous match."
"Segments","Segment A","Segment == ""Segment A""","0.600","Mapped to data map variable 'Segment'. The original expression 'Segment A from list' suggests a value label. The data map does not list answer options for 'Segment', so assumed the label is 'Segment A'. Confidence reduced due to unknown coding of values."
"Segments","Segment B","Segment == ""Segment B""","0.600","Mapped to data map variable 'Segment'. The original expression 'Segment B from list' suggests a value label. The data map does not list answer options for 'Segment', so assumed the label is 'Segment B'. Confidence reduced due to unknown coding of values."
"Segments","Segment C","Segment == ""Segment C""","0.600","Mapped to data map variable 'Segment'. The original expression 'Segment C from list' suggests a value label. The data map does not list answer options for 'Segment', so assumed the label is 'Segment C'. Confidence reduced due to unknown coding of values."
"Segments","Segment D","Segment == ""Segment D""","0.600","Mapped to data map variable 'Segment'. The original expression 'Segment D from list' suggests a value label. The data map does not list answer options for 'Segment', so assumed the label is 'Segment D'. Confidence reduced due to unknown coding of values."
"Priority Accounts","Priority Account","qLIST_PRIORITY_ACCOUNT == 1","0.970","Direct mapping: 'Priority Account from list' aligns exactly with qLIST_PRIORITY_ACCOUNT value 1=PRIORITY in the data map. Clear and unambiguous mapping."
"Priority Accounts","Non-Priority Account","qLIST_PRIORITY_ACCOUNT == 2","0.970","Direct mapping: 'Non-Priority Account from list' aligns exactly with qLIST_PRIORITY_ACCOUNT value 2=NOT PRIORITY in the data map. Clear and unambiguous mapping."
