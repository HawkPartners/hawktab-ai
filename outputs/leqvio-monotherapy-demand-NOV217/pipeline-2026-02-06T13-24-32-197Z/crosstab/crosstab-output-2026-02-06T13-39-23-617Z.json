Search found S2 and S2a both containing 'Cardiologist' as value 1; selected both S2 and S2a because the original expression explicitly checks either specialty or office type for cardiologists.\n\nColumn PCPs: Expression type direct_variable.

Full data map scan: found S11 exact match with description '... how many have a confirmed diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia with established cardiovascular disease (CVD)?' No other variables with the same meaning; S10 exists (total adult patients managed per month) but is broader and not specific to ASCVD/hypercholesterolemia.
