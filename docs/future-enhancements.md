# Future Enhancements & Next Steps

## 1. Context Enrichment - DEFERRED
### Value Type Integration
- Pass value types/labels into agent context alongside variables
- Would improve confidence scoring for conceptual matches (e.g., SEGMENT variables)
- Could flag variables missing value types during data map processing as warnings

## 2. Tracing Optimization - COMPLETED ✅
### Solution Implemented
- Used `withTrace()` wrapper to create single unified trace for all group processing
- All group processing now appears under one trace instead of separate traces
- Each group's agent run becomes a span within the main trace
- Implemented `getGlobalTraceProvider().forceFlush()` for immediate trace export
- Trace ID capture and inclusion in API responses for debugging reference
- ESLint configuration updated to properly handle underscore-prefixed unused variables

## 2A. Banner Processing Agent Optimization - COMPLETED ✅
### Solution Implemented
- **Converted to Agent-Based Processing**: Replaced BannerProcessor with BannerAgent using OpenAI Agents SDK
- **Added Scratchpad Tool**: Enables reasoning transparency with visible decision-making process
- **Enhanced Group Separation**: Alternative prompt version explicitly focuses on logical group identification
- **Multi-Page PDF Support**: Fixed DOC→PDF conversion to properly handle content spanning multiple pages  
- **Proper Page Processing**: Page-by-page image conversion ensures all content is analyzed
- **Environment-Based Prompts**: Uses `BANNER_PROMPT_VERSION=alternative` for enhanced group separation

### Results Achieved  
- **Excellent Group Separation**: Consistently identifies 6+ logical groups (Specialty, Role, Volume, Tiers, Segments, Priority)
- **Reasoning Transparency**: Scratchpad shows group identification logic ("Identified 6 logical banner cut groups based on headers and spacing...")
- **Architecture Consistency**: All major processing now uses unified Agents SDK patterns
- **Robust Processing**: Handles both single-page and multi-page banner documents correctly

## 3. Validation & Grading System
### Simple Validation UI (Phase 1 - Immediate Priority)
- **Non-blocking validation workflow**: Complete pipeline first, then optionally validate
- **Validation queue interface**: List all pending/validated sessions
- **Banner validation tab**: Form-based editing with auto-calculated success rates
- **Crosstab validation tab**: Column-by-column feedback with confidence ratings
- **Status tracking**: Simple pending/validated states in session folders
- **Batch-friendly design**: Validate multiple sessions when convenient

### Scratchpad UI Enhancement (Phase 2)
- **Save scratchpad output**: Store agent reasoning in session folders
- **Display scratchpad in UI**: Show reasoning for each decision in validation interface  
- **Transparency view**: See how agents analyzed banner groups and variable mappings
- **Debug-friendly**: Understand why agents made specific choices

### ⚠️ PAUSE HERE FOR THOROUGH TESTING
**Before proceeding to next phases:**
- Test CrossTab agent output with diverse banner plans and data maps
- Iterate and fix issues using the new validation UI
- Collect feedback patterns from multiple test scenarios
- Ensure agent accuracy meets requirements
- Build confidence in current implementation before adding complexity

## 4. Output Processing Pipeline
### Banner Plan Merging
- Take CrossTab agent output
- Merge with original banner plan
- Override fields: adjusted, confidence, reason
- Create new enhanced banner plan with validation results
- Save merged output for downstream processing

### Total Column Addition
- Add "Total" column to banner plan post-CrossTab validation
- Enables significance testing between total and subgroups
- Could be deterministic logic or lightweight LLM call
- Assign appropriate statistical letter (typically 'T')
- Include universe/base definition for total

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow
- Trigger manual review when confidence < threshold (e.g., 0.70)
- Queue low-confidence mappings for human validation
- Track corrections for future training/prompt improvement
- Build feedback loop for continuous improvement

## 5. Testing Infrastructure
### Batch Processing System
- Process multiple banner plans/data maps in batch
- Collect performance metrics across diverse inputs
- A/B test different prompt versions systematically
- Generate accuracy reports and identify failure patterns

### Test Suite Development
- Curated set of banner plans with known-correct mappings
- Edge cases and complex expressions
- Performance benchmarks for processing speed
- Regression testing for prompt changes

### QA System
- **QA Agent/Module**: Automated quality assurance for outputs
- Validate R syntax correctness
- Check variable references exist in data
- Verify statistical logic consistency
- Flag potential issues before execution
- Could be agent-based or deterministic validation

## 6. R Script Generation
### Next Major Phase (Agent-Based)
- **R Script Generation Agent**: Convert validated mappings to executable R syntax
- Generate complete crosstab scripts with proper syntax
- Handle data transformations and aggregations
- Include significance testing logic
- Integration with R execution environment
- Agent will understand R best practices and optimization

## 7. Advanced Agent Capabilities
### Multi-Variable Logic
- Better handling of complex AND/OR combinations
- Nested conditional expressions
