"groupName","name","expression","confidence","reason"
"Specialty","Total","status == 3","0.970","Mapped to status variable; value 3 corresponds to Qualified respondents per data map. Direct, unambiguous mapping."
"Specialty","Cards","(S2 == 1 & S2a == 1)","0.900","Mapped S2 and S2a directly; S2=1 (Cardiologist) and S2a=1 (works in cardiologist office). Combined with & per R syntax. Precise but multi-variable, hence moderate-high confidence."
"Specialty","PCPs","S2 == 2","0.980","Mapped to S2 variable; value 2 corresponds to Internal Medicine / General Practitioner / Primary Care / Family Practice (PCP). Direct mapping."
"Specialty","Nephs","S2 == 3","0.980","Mapped to S2 variable; value 3 corresponds to Nephrologist. Direct mapping."
"Specialty","Endos","S2 == 4","0.980","Mapped to S2 variable; value 4 corresponds to Endocrinologist. Direct mapping."
"Specialty","Lipids","S2 == 5","0.980","Mapped to S2 variable; value 5 corresponds to Lipidologist. Direct mapping."
"Role","Total","status == 3","0.950","The data map variable 'status' codes 3 as 'Qualified'; mapping 'qualified respondents' to status == 3 is a direct, unambiguous match."
"Role","HCP","S2b == 1","0.900","Interpreted 'HCP' (healthcare professional) as physicians per the 'primary role' variable S2b (1=Physician). Considered using qSPECIALTY %in% c(1,2) but chose S2b for direct role mapping; confidence reduced slightly for conceptual interpretation."
"Role","NP/PA","S2b %in% c(2, 3)","0.950","'NP/PA' directly corresponds to S2b codes 2 (Nurse Practitioner) and 3 (Physician’s Assistant); this is a precise, direct mapping."
"Volume of Adult ASCVD Patients","Total","!is.na(S11)","0.840","Mapped “qualified respondents” to respondents with non-missing S11, since S11 records the count of adult patients with ASCVD. No dedicated qualifier variable exists, so non-missing S11 indicates qualification."
"Volume of Adult ASCVD Patients","Higher","S11 > median(S11, na.rm = TRUE)","0.400","Original text is a placeholder. Assumed a median split on S11 to define “Higher” volume. Alternative cutoffs could be used; this is a provisional mapping pending specified threshold."
"Volume of Adult ASCVD Patients","Lower","S11 <= median(S11, na.rm = TRUE)","0.400","Original text is a placeholder. Assumed a median split on S11 to define “Lower” volume. Alternative cutoffs could be used; this is a provisional mapping pending specified threshold."
"Tiers","Total","status == 3","0.800","Mapped “qualified respondents” to the data map variable status, where 3 = Qualified respondents. Only one plausible match found, hence conceptual inference with high confidence."
"Tiers","Tier 1","qLIST_TIER == 1","0.950","Direct mapping to qLIST_TIER which has value 1 = TIER 1 in the data map. Unambiguous match."
"Tiers","Tier 2","qLIST_TIER == 2","0.950","Direct mapping to qLIST_TIER which has value 2 = TIER 2 in the data map. Unambiguous match."
"Tiers","Tier 3","qLIST_TIER == 3","0.950","Direct mapping to qLIST_TIER which has value 3 = TIER 3 in the data map. Unambiguous match."
"Tiers","Tier 4","qLIST_TIER == 4","0.950","Direct mapping to qLIST_TIER which has value 4 = TIER 4 in the data map. Unambiguous match."
"Segments","Total","status == 3","0.950","Mapped ""qualified respondents"" to status == 3 based on data map variable 'status' where 3 = Qualified. Direct match with clear value label."
"Segments","Segment A","Segment == ""Segment A""","0.600","Data map contains variable 'Segment' (captured variable) but no answer options defined. Assuming value label exactly matches ""Segment A"" from the original. Code values not provided; manual verification of actual coding recommended."
"Segments","Segment B","Segment == ""Segment B""","0.600","Using the captured variable 'Segment' (no defined codes), assumed label ""Segment B"" aligns with original. Actual coding format (e.g., numeric vs string) unknown; please confirm."
"Segments","Segment C","Segment == ""Segment C""","0.600","Assumed 'Segment' variable holds a label ""Segment C"" matching the original. No answer options in data map; manual code check needed."
"Segments","Segment D","Segment == ""Segment D""","0.600","Mapped to 'Segment' == ""Segment D"" by assumption of label matching. Data map lacks value definitions; confirm actual coding."
"Priority Accounts","Total","status == 3","0.950","Mapped ""qualified respondents"" to the status variable, where status == 3 corresponds to “Qualified” per the data map (Answer_Options: 3=Qualified). Direct variable and value match yields high confidence."
"Priority Accounts","Priority Account","qLIST_PRIORITY_ACCOUNT == 1","0.950","Mapped ""Priority Account from list"" to the qLIST_PRIORITY_ACCOUNT variable (“LIST PRIORITY ACCOUNT”), where 1=PRIORITY. Direct label match with clear mapping."
"Priority Accounts","Non-Priority Account","qLIST_PRIORITY_ACCOUNT == 2","0.950","Mapped ""Non-Priority Account from list"" to the qLIST_PRIORITY_ACCOUNT variable (“LIST PRIORITY ACCOUNT”), where 2=NOT PRIORITY. Direct label match with clear mapping."
